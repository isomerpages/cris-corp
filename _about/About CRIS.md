The Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS) was established in 2020 with the goal of strengthening synergies and developing strategies for national-level clinical research and translation programmes that are under the stewardship of the Ministry of Health. It is a subsidiary of the Ministry of Health Holdings (MOHH).
