<h3>Recap key insights from August's CRIS Connect Webinar:</h3>
<p>The webinar opened with a sharing by Dr Esther Lee, Assistant Director
(Healthcare Innovation &amp; Transformation) who elaborated on NHIC's role
in identifying and commercialising promising clinical innovations across
Singapore’s public healthcare institutions. She shared further about the
I2Adopt grant, which is designed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing
innovations, engage clinicians, healthcare clusters and policy divisions
to address barriers, and provide strategies and resources to support adoption
and scaling. She also spotlighted examples of innovations that have benefitted
from the I2Adopt grant, including aiTriage™ and FxMammo, a radiological
computer-assisted detection and software intended to aid in the detection
of breast cancer on acquired mammography images.</p>
<p>Prof Marcus Ong, Senior Consultant &amp; Distinguished Senior Clinician,
Department of Emergency Medicine, Singapore General Hospital (SGH), highlighted
a global challenge in healthcare: hundreds of millions of patients visit
emergency departments, clinics or general practitioners each year for chest
pain, yet up to 83% of these cases are not cardiac-related. Current triage
methods often require serial blood tests to rule out low-risk cases, making
the process expensive and resource-intensive for both hospitals and patients.</p>
<p>Heart rate variability (HRV), defined as the variation in time between
consecutive heartbeats, has been studied extensively in critically ill
ICU patients, as well as in conditions such as sepsis and trauma. Building
on 20 years of research, the team led by Prof Marcus Ong developed aiTriage™,
a solution designed to work within existing standards of care to identify
low-risk patients for safe discharge and high-risk patients for earlier
intervention. By integrating seamlessly into clinical workflows, aiTriage™
aims to support faster decision-making, more efficient use of hospital
resources and ultimately, better patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Prof Ong outlined the journey of TIIM Healthcare, beginning with its formation
as a research team in 2007. In 2015, the team received the Innovation to
Develop (I2D) grant from the <a href="https://www.nhic.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">National Health Innovation Centre Singapore (NHIC)</a>.
Later in 2023, it was awarded the Innovation to Adopt (I2Adopt) grant to
evaluate aiTriage in a cross-cluster clinical implementation study involving
institutions such as SGH and Tan Tock Seng Hospital. The study demonstrated
that the safety of adopting aiTriage™ as a clinical decision support tool;
it was effective in improving turnaround time for patients, and helpful
in reducing unnecessary admissions.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the team aims to extend aiTriage™ as a reliable and effective
risk-stratification platform for conditions such as chest pain, heart failure,
sepsis and trauma. Their long-term vision is to improve healthcare efficiency
and enhance patient outcomes through timely care and intervention.</p>
<p>Speaking from his experience as a clinician scientist, Prof Ong stressed
that medical innovation must be grounded in Science but also requires close
collaboration with trusted business partners. He expressed gratitude to
NHIC for their strong support in the team's innovation journey, highlighting
that innovation goes beyond commercialisation, it is also about learning,
creating value and ensuring effective implementation.</p>
<p>On a whole, the webinar highlighted the importance of bridging scientific
research with clinical application to address pressing healthcare challenges.
Through collaborative partnerships, sustained research and strong institutional
support to enable adoption at scale, innovations such as aiTriage™ demonstrate
how healthtech can enhance patient care, optimise resources and build a
more resilient healthcare system for the future.</p>
