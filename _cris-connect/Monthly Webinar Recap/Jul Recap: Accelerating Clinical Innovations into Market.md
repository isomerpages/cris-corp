<h4>Recap key insights from July's CRIS Connect Webinar:</h4>
<p>The webinar spotlighted the pivotal role NHIC plays in Singapore’s healthtech
ecosystem by identifying, funding, and commercialising clinical innovations
from public health institutions. With its dual mandate of economic growth
and healthcare impact, NHIC provides project guidance, consultancy, and
strategic partnerships spanning co-development, co-funding, test-bedding,
and global market access. These efforts not only accelerate translation
from bench to bedside but also foster meaningful international collaborations
that expand opportunities for Singapore’s clinical community.</p>
<p>A prime example would be the Paxman Limb Cryocompression System (PLCS),
a local innovation to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.
Combining limb cooling with cyclic compression, the device enhances patient
safety and tolerability compared to traditional frozen gloves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spanning multiple sites in Singapore, the trial saw&nbsp;76.5% of patients
completing all planned treatment with cryocompression, while the drop-out
rate was only 9.7% due to cold intolerance. In all, 67% of patients completed
the treatment without dose reduction.</p>
<p>PLCS’ journey from proof-of-concept to global clinical trials highlights
how multidisciplinary collaboration, user feedback, and NHIC’s support
can fast-track promising technologies into impactful healthcare solutions
with international reach.</p>
