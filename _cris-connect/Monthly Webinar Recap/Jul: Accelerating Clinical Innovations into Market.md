<h3>Recap key insights from July's CRIS Connect Webinar:</h3>
<p>The webinar spotlighted the pivotal role NHIC plays in Singapore’s healthtech
ecosystem by identifying, funding, and commercialising clinical innovations
from public health institutions.</p>
<p>With its dual mandate of economic growth and healthcare impact, NHIC provides
project guidance, consultancy, and strategic partnerships spanning co-development,
co-funding, test-bedding, and global market access. These efforts not only
accelerate translation from bench to bedside but also foster meaningful
international collaborations that expand opportunities for Singapore’s
clinical community.</p>
<p>A prime example would be the Paxman Limb Cryocompression System (PLCS),
a local innovation to prevent chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.
Combining limb cooling with cyclic compression, the device enhances patient
safety and tolerability compared to traditional frozen gloves.&nbsp;Spanning
multiple sites in Singapore, the trial saw&nbsp;76.5% of patients completing
all planned treatment with cryocompression, while the drop-out rate was
only 9.7% due to cold intolerance. In all, 67% of patients completed the
treatment without dose reduction.</p>
<p>PLCS’ journey from proof-of-concept to global clinical trials highlights
how multidisciplinary collaboration, engaging user feedback and NHIC’s
support can fast-track promising technologies into impactful healthcare
solutions to deliver better patient outcomes.</p>
