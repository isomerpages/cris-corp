<h3>Recap key insights from June's CRIS Connect Webinar:</h3>
<p>The webinar spotlighted the PRECISE-funded Pre-emptive Pharmacogenomics
(PPGx) Clinical Implementation Pilot (CIP). The PPGx CIP has demonstrated
the feasibility of scaling pre-emptive PGx testing across seven institutions
and more than 2,000 patients.</p>
<p>By integrating structured test results into clinical decision support
systems, the pilot study has enabled genotype-guided prescribing and real-world
changes to prescriptions. Key enablers included strong clinician leadership,
top-down management support, robust informatics infrastructure, targeted
training and administrative frameworks for systemic change.</p>
<p>Importantly, the pilot has also laid the foundation for validating Asian-specific
PPGx variants, positioning Singapore to lead in regional discovery and
translation. These insights will be crucial in informing the upcoming Phase
III of the National Precision Medicine programme, which aims to scale PPGx
implementation nationally.</p>
<p>The speakers also emphasised the broader context of precision medicine
which stratifies patients by genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors.
This offers clearer, more scalable benefits than the often-misinterpreted
“personalised medicine.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Singapore, findings from the SG10K study are already revealing population-specific
risks, from adverse drug reactions to dosing sensitivities, highlighting
the clinical and system-level impact of embedding PPGx testing into routine
care.</p>
