<h3>Recap key insights from June's CRIS Connect Webinar:</h3>
<p>The webinar spotlighted Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE)'s
Pre-emptive Pharmacogenomics (PPGx) Clinical Implementation Pilot (CIP).
The PPGx CIP has demonstrated the feasibility of scaling pre-emptive PGx
testing across seven institutions and more than 2,000 patients.</p>
<p>By integrating structured test results into clinical decision support
systems, the pilot study has enabled genotype-guided prescribing and real-world
changes to prescriptions. Key enablers included strong clinician leadership,
top-down management support, robust informatics infrastructure, targeted
training and administrative frameworks for systemic change.</p>
<p>Importantly, the pilot has also laid the foundation for validating Asian-specific
PPGx variants, positioning Singapore to lead in regional discovery and
translation. These insights will be crucial in informing the upcoming Phase
III of the National Precision Medicine programme, which aims to scale PPGx
implementation nationally.</p>
<p>The speakers also emphasised the broader context of precision medicine
which stratifies patients by genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors.
Findings from the SG10K study are already revealing population-specific
risks, from adverse drug reactions to dosing sensitivities, highlighting
the clinical and system-level impact of embedding PPGx testing into routine
care.</p>
<p>Specifically, Dr Wan Yi Min, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist at Ng Teng
Fong General Hospital, shared a use case about a patient diagnosed with
major depressive disorder. The prescription had caused the patient to experience
side effects such as emotional numbing, excessive drowsiness and reduced
functionality. Through the PPGx pilot, the patient’s DNA was sequenced
and Dr Wan was provided with a report highlighting how the patient’s genetic
makeup would cause potential issues with dosing, medicine efficacy and
side effects. This enabled Dr Wan to adjust the medication and optimise
the dosage based on the patient's genetic profile. The revised and tailored
treatment led to significant improvements as the patient regained emotional
well-being and renewed interest in life.</p>
<p>The PPGx approach, not only enhanced treatment effectiveness but also
empowered the patient with better-informed decisions. On a larger level,
this offers clearer, more scalable benefits than the often-misinterpreted
“personalised medicine.”&nbsp;</p>
