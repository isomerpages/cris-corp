<h3>Recap key insights from May's CRIS Connect Webinar:</h3>
<p>For the first CRIS Connect webinar, the speakers underscored how precision
medicine is reshaping preventive care in Singapore, highlighting the role
of genomics, clinical implementation pilots and economic evaluation in
driving sustainable healthcare.</p>

<p>Ms Iraeneus Chia, Manager, PRECISE, outlined the programme's mission to
work with the ecosystem in harnessing genomics for preventive health. PRECISE
aims to identify individuals and groups at higher genetic risk, uplift
these groups with cost-effective treatments and reduce inequities through
informed policies. To support this vision, five clinical implementation
pilots (CIPs) have been launched, focusing on familial hypercholesterolaemia
(FH), breast cancer screening, hereditary cancers, kidney disease and pre-emptive
pharmacogenomics.</p>
<p>A major milestone was achieved on 30 June 2025, with the launch of Singapore’s
first national FH genetic testing programme. This initiative seeks to detect
FH, a common but underdiagnosed genetic condition that increases the risk
of premature heart disease, at an early stage, enabling timely interventions.
Eligible patients are identified in primary care and referred for genetic
testing at the Genetic Assessment Centre.</p>
<p>A/Prof Tavintharan Subramaniam, Senior Consultant, Diabetes Centre, Admiralty
Medical Centre, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) and Deputy Director, Clinical
Research Unit, KTPH, elaborated on how FH is being integrated into clinical
practice through the CIP. While FH patients face a 20-fold higher risk
of cardiovascular disease, fewer than 10% display clinical signs, often
leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. The FHCARE team provided a
structured pathway, including systematic screening, specialist assessment,
genetic testing, and pre-test counselling by trained coordinators. Patients
with confirmed genetic results can invite family members for cascade screening,
ensuring earlier detection and treatment for at-risk relatives. With the
roll-out of the national genetic testing programme, the team plans to expand
population-level screening to identify individuals with high LDL cholesterol,
paving the way for earlier, definitive diagnosis and comprehensive care.</p>
<p>Bringing an economic lens to the discussion, A/Prof Wee Hwee Lin, Director,
Centre for Health Interventions and Policy Evaluation Research (HIPER),
Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore
(NUS), emphasised that healthcare policies must balance unlimited needs
with finite resources, “Scarcity is a fundamental concept in economics.
Economics is about trade-offs". Cost-effectiveness is assessed through
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and quality-adjusted life
years (QALYs), which measure the quantity and quality of life gained through
interventions. In Singapore, health technology assessment has been strengthened
to evaluate high-cost treatments, including precision medicine. While genetic
screening and preventive care incur upfront costs, they help avoid the
far greater costs of advanced disease management.</p>
<p>Together, the speakers highlighted how precision medicine, clinical innovation
and economic evaluation are crucial in advancing preventive health and
ensure equitable, sustainable healthcare for Singapore’s population.</p>
