**How do I choose an appropriate gift for my recipients?**
* Please refer to the catalogue featuring various brands. Take into consideration the type of items available and their corresponding prices. You are highly encouraged to discuss with your RO or your team to ensure the gift aligns with the significance of the event and your recipients.


**I have decided on a gift. How do I procure the item(s) for my upcoming event / meeting?** 
* Seek an email approval from your RO, clearly stating the selected item(s). The email should include an additional liner if customisation is required.
* Fill out the [Gift Request Form](for.sg/cris-corp-form) and attach the email approval.
* Please note that the Gift Request Form is the official channel for requesting gifts, and it is essential to provide the required information accurately.
