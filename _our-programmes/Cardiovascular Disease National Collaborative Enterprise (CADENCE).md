Established in February 2023, the **CA**rdiovascular **D**iseas**E** **N**ational **C**ollaborative **E**nterprise (CADENCE) is a national clinical translational programme aimed at synergising cardiovascular research and technology capabilities across Singapore. 

Its goal is to integrate existing research capabilities, and bring together the strongest basic, clinical, and translational talent and expertise across Singapore and institutions, to become the leading Asian centre in CVD R&T. 

CADENCE will establish four national joint platforms focused on data science, clinical trials, and artificial intelligence/digital health, together with a business intelligence and development unit to attract industry collaborations/external investments. 

CADENCE is now in the first stage of implementation, focused on establishing operational capabilities of the four joint platforms.
