The CArdiovascular DiseasE National Collaborative Enterprise (CADENCE) National Clinical Translational Program (NCTP) was established in Feb 2023 as a nationally coordinated initiative and network to bring together and synergise cardiovascular research & technology (R&T) and translational capabilities across Singapore.

Singapore has established internationally competitive basic, translational, and clinical research talent, state-of-the-art research facilities, and multi-site clinical research infrastructure in CV research. CADENCE aims to take CVD R&T to the next level by bringing together these peaks of research excellence, and propelling Singapore as the leading Asian centre in CVD R&T. To achieve this goal, we will integrate existing research capabilities, and bring together the strongest basic, clinical, and translational talent and expertise across Singapore and institutions (including NHCS, NUHCS, TTSH, NUS, Duke-NUS Medical School, NTU and A\*STAR), into a focused and impactful national-level CVD R&T programme with world-class peaks of excellence. 

CADENCE will have upfront agreement between multi-institutional parties on how resources and outputs such as data, tissues and intellectual property will be brought together, shared and enhanced as critical enablers for Singapore to be globally competitive in research and translation. It will work through multi-institutional pain-points constraining ecosystem level research and translation and put in place national level frameworks and upfront agreements to address them. 

CADENCE will establish 3 national joint platforms focused on data science, clinical trials and AI/digital health with a focus on translating the programme’s research into preventive health and public health outcomes. Underpinning the platforms will be a new business intelligence and development unit (BIDU) to attract industry collaborations/external investments and provide outreach to wider research and clinical communities. We have identified three strategic Use Cases that will contribute to the development of peaks of research excellence in identified clinical domain areas of priority and support value-based healthcare and cost-effective care delivery.

CADENCE is now in Stage 1 of implementation and is focused on establishing operational capabilities of the four Joint Platforms and launching the 3 Use Cases.
