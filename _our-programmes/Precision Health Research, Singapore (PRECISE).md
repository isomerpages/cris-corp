<p>Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) is the central entity set
up to coordinate a whole-of-government effort to implement Singapore’s
three-phase National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme.</p>
<p>NPM Phase II sequenced 100,000 Singaporeans and conducted clinical implementation
studies, linking genomic, lifestyle, and healthcare data to deepen understanding
of Asian diseases.</p>

<p>NPM Phase III programme reflects the shared commitment of PRECISE and
Singapore’s three public healthcare clusters to work together and enrol
about 10% of Singapore's local resident population as study participants
by 2030.</p>
<p>Conducted as a large-scale research initiative, NPM Phase III will generate
robust, population-specific evidence to analyse the cost and effectiveness
of using genomic information in healthcare when scaled beyond pilots to
population levels. These insights will help guide how genomic information
could, in future, be responsibly integrated into healthcare to support
physicians and patients in preventive and more targeted care.</p>
