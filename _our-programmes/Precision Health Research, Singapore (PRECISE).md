Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) is the central entity set up to coordinate a whole-of- government effort to implement Phase II of Singapore’s 10-year National Precision Medicine (NPM) strategy.

NPM Phase II aims to transform healthcare in Singapore and improve patient outcomes through new insights into the Asian genome and data-driven healthcare solutions. NPM Phase II will also enhance the breadth and depth of the Precision Medicine-related industry by attracting and anchoring overseas companies in Singapore, while yielding new opportunities for home-grown companies.
