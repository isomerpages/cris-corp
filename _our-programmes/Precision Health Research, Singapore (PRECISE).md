<p>NPM Phase II aims to transform healthcare in Singapore and improve patient
outcomes through new insights into the Asian genome and data-driven healthcare
solutions. NPM Phase II will also enhance the breadth and depth of the
Precision Medicine-related industry by attracting and anchoring overseas
companies in Singapore, while yielding new opportunities for home-grown
companies.</p>
