Established in 2008, the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI) was set up as the national academic clinical research organisation to enhance the standards of clinical research in Singapore by developing core capabilities, infrastructure and scientific leadership for clinical research. 

In 2021, SCRI was appointed as the national coordinating body to implement the national clinical trial strategy and enhance Singapore’s clinical trial ecosystem.
