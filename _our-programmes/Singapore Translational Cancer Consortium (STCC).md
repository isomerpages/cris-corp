#### STCC

The Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium (STCC) is a nationally-coordinated consortium to synergise cancer research capabilities in Singapore.

Established in 2020, STCC brings together unmatched basic, clinical and translational talent in Singapore to create globally significant peaks of excellence in selected Asian cancers. 

STCC’s four joint platforms – Clinical Trials and Investigational Medicine Units, Cancer Database and Tissue Banks, Translational Assays and Models, and Business Intelligence and Development Unit – provide an enabling research and innovation environment driven to foster translational research with meaningful outcomes for society.

Through these forged collaborative relationships between local cancer research groups and by capitalising on the strengths of industry and academia, STCC is uniquely poised to develop initiatives that are aligned with Singapore’s goals in value-based healthcare innovation and economic value creation.
