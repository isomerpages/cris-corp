<p>In 2023, CRIS initiated a series of webinars to engage, inform and inspire
its staff and peers across the healthcare and clinical research ecosystem.
This year, in celebration of CRIS’ 5th Anniversary, we are pleased to bring
back the CRIS Connect webinar series.</p>
<p>Curated by the team from Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI),
CRIS Connect brings together colleagues from our CRIS programmes, ecosystem
partners, clinicians, researchers, innovators and thought leaders.</p>
<p>The monthly webinar is designed to facilitate and spark meaningful conversations
about the work carried out by our CRIS programmes. This includes discussions
on emerging trends that have become increasingly important in today’s healthcare
system as well as initiatives that are driving transformation, improving
system efficiency and enhancing patient journeys and experiences.</p>
