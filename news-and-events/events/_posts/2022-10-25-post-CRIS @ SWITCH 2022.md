**Date:** 25 October 2022  
**Time:** 1:35 – 2:15pm

Cell and gene therapies (CGT) are the latest revolution in clinical care of non-curable diseases and medicine manufacturing technologies. These “living” drugs use live stem or mature cells to treat diseases.

By 2021, regulatory authorities across the globe have approved more than 60 CGT assets with another 100 over products being considered for expedited approval. Based on market reports by Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, the sector raised close to US$20B in 2020, a 50% increase over the previous year.

Over the past decade, Asia has witnessed a wave of first-in-human clinical trials for CGT along with formation of a de-centralised manufacturing sites. For example, In Singapore, the state of  clinical infrastructure, well-established R&D programmes, comprehensive regulatory framework, manufacturing capabilities and evolving startup ecosystem, is also uniquely positioned in Asia to contribute to the expedition of the development, adoption and access to CGT.

This panel comprises clinical, R&D and commercialisation leaders who will discuss the key milestones of CGT developmental programmes, with a spotlight on the R&D ecosystem and areas of focus that would impact Asian populations, clinical and regulatory capabilities in the region, and the manufacturing and commercialisation enablers of CGTs in Asia.

**Date:** 25 October 2022  
**Time:** 4:15 – 4:55pm

Tech startups in Singapore raised US$11.2B in the first nine months of 2021.  Catapulting to the limelight are the city state’s biotech/medtech startups which raised an unprecedented US$600M from Jan-Sep 2021. Singapore subsequently snagged the top spot in the world in 2022 for startups attracting more venture capital funds per capita ($695M per capita; total US$4.1 billion) than other advanced economies.

In a post-pandemic era with increasing geopolitical uncertainty, is Southeast Asia (SEA) becoming a new beacon of hope for those seeking alternative locations to run and raise funds for biotechs/medtechs?  

Before you think of starting a biotech/medtech company here, there are various fundamentals you should consider. We bring together a panel of experts who have been in the thick of things right here in SEA; sharing experiences from the perspectives of a clinician innovator, regulatory expert, biotech entrepreneur and a global MNC lead. The panel will discuss practical considerations of running a biotech/medtech startup and scaling it in the region. Expect candid discussions on issues such as invention and development, intellectual property, ethics and regulatory clearances, partnerships, market entry and expansion, and talent management.
