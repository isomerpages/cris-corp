##### **Reimagining the Future of Clinical Trials**  #####
 
 **Date:** 31 Oct 2023 <br>
**Time:** 11:20 - 12:05pm

The success of future clinical trials requires a Patient-Centric trial approach and a transformation in how trials are designed, conducted, monitored, adapted, reported, and regulated to generate the best evidence.  

Advances in Technology, such as telemedicine and remote monitoring may become more broadly used for clinical trials in the future. Late-stage clinical trial processes will be reimagined to increase efficiency while transforming experiences for patients, industry, and healthcare professionals.  

The future of clinical trials is exciting and full of possibilities. By embracing patient-centric trials, leveraging advances in technology, breaking silos, and increasing efficiency, we can reimagine the way we conduct research and generate the best evidence to improve patient outcomes.

##### **Precision and Predictive Medicineâ€“the Future is Now**

**Date:** 31 Oct 2023 <br>
**Time:** 4:20 - 5:05pm

Once thought to be a science fiction fantasy, precision medicine is fast becoming reality. With the rapid advancement of predictive analytics and genomic sequencing capabilities, nations around the world are using data-driven insights to enhance healthcare policies and services to improve population health.  

Advanced genetic testing now allows for targeted screening of specific cancers biomarkers, allowing for early detection and treatment strategies, improving patient outcomes with fewer side effects. We are at the cusp of realising the immense potential in harnessing the benefits of data-driven healthcare, supported by robust infrastructure, technology, and AI.  

This panel will feature speakers from both public and private healthcare sectors to discuss how precision medicine will shape the future of healthcare.

##### **How Technology is Shaping the Future of Healthcare in Asia**&nbsp; ##### 

**Date:** 31 Oct 2023 <br>
**Time:** 5:10 - 5:55pm

Stakeholders around the world are looking for innovative, cost-effective ways to deliver patient-centric, technology-enabled solutions to patients within and outside hospitals. With rising costs, manpower shortages, aging populations and increasing chronic diseases, healthcare providers in Asia have been harnessing breakthrough technology to innovate new solutions to overcome these challenges. 

These technologies range from AI to reduce wait times and enhance preventative care through personalised health plans, to the use of cloud technology to scale vaccine operations and AR to assist with surgery.  

Hear from technology giants, regional health systems and startups as they examine the role of technology in transforming healthcare from a patient and provider perspective, and what this would mean for the wider health ecosystem going forward.<p></p>
