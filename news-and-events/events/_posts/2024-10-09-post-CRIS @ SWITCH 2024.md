<p><strong>Date:</strong> 28 Oct 2024
<br><strong>Time:</strong> 10:30am - 11:15am</p>
<p>Digital Twin technologies are poised to transform healthcare by creating
“digital mirrors” and simulations of patients and healthcare systems, enabling
personalised, analytics-powered, data-driven care delivery. In this panel,
experts from clinical practice, academia, industry and healthcare management
will come together to explore the potential of these innovations to improve
chronic disease management, enhance reproductive health, and optimise operational
efficiency within healthcare systems. We will examine the various approaches
taken by academia and industry to drive this transformation, including
the integration of advanced AI/ML techniques and the role of computational
biology in shaping this innovative approach to healthcare.</p>
<p>The discussion will also focus on the roadmap to clinical adoption, addressing
key challenges such as validation, regulatory approval, cost-effectiveness
and the metrics that determine success. This is a unique opportunity to
engage with leaders at the forefront of healthcare innovation and gain
a deeper understanding of how Digital Twins could transform the future
of healthcare delivery.</p>

<p><strong>Date:</strong> 28 Oct 2024
<br><strong>Time:</strong> 11.20am - 12:05pm</p>
<p>Precision medicine is on the precipice of rapid expansion. With the advancement
of predictive analytics and genomic sequencing capabilities, nations around
the world are using data-driven insights to shift from reactive to proactive
care models.</p>
<p>Data is the engine of precision medicine. In Singapore, the National Precision
Medicine (NPM) programme stands at the forefront of this transformation.</p>
<p>From local community-based studies to global health initiatives, precision
medicine generates insights that are reflected in our technology advancements,
our treatments and the way we deliver care. How is Singapore’s National
Precision Medicine programme laying the groundwork to turn these insights
into tangible clinical applications? What other roles does precision medicine
play in reshaping healthcare? What are the challenges and opportunities
in leveraging health data for broader health outcomes?</p>
<p>Hear from speakers from both public and private healthcare sectors as
they examine the role of precision medicine in transforming healthcare
from an innovator and provider perspective, and what the future holds for
the wider health ecosystem going forward.</p>
