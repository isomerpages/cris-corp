<p><strong>Date:</strong> 31 Oct 2023
<br><strong>Time:</strong> 11:20 - 12:05pm</p>
<p>The success of future clinical trials requires a Patient-Centric trial
approach and a transformation in how trials are designed, conducted, monitored,
adapted, reported, and regulated to generate the best evidence.</p>
<p>Advances in Technology, such as telemedicine and remote monitoring may
become more broadly used for clinical trials in the future. Late-stage
clinical trial processes will be reimagined to increase efficiency while
transforming experiences for patients, industry, and healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>The future of clinical trials is exciting and full of possibilities. By
embracing patient-centric trials, leveraging advances in technology, breaking
silos, and increasing efficiency, we can reimagine the way we conduct research
and generate the best evidence to improve patient outcomes.</p>
<h5><strong>Precision and Predictive Medicineâ€“the Future is Now</strong></h5>

<br><strong>Time:</strong> 4:20 - 5:05pm</p>
<p>Once thought to be a science fiction fantasy, precision medicine is fast
becoming reality. With the rapid advancement of predictive analytics and
genomic sequencing capabilities, nations around the world are using data-driven
insights to enhance healthcare policies and services to improve population
health.</p>
<p>Advanced genetic testing now allows for targeted screening of specific
cancers biomarkers, allowing for early detection and treatment strategies,
improving patient outcomes with fewer side effects. We are at the cusp
of realising the immense potential in harnessing the benefits of data-driven
healthcare, supported by robust infrastructure, technology, and AI.</p>
<p>This panel will feature speakers from both public and private healthcare
sectors to discuss how precision medicine will shape the future of healthcare.</p>
<h5><strong>How Technology is Shaping the Future of Healthcare in Asia</strong>&nbsp;</h5>

<br><strong>Time:</strong> 5:10 - 5:55pm</p>
<p>Stakeholders around the world are looking for innovative, cost-effective
ways to deliver patient-centric, technology-enabled solutions to patients
within and outside hospitals. With rising costs, manpower shortages, aging
populations and increasing chronic diseases, healthcare providers in Asia
have been harnessing breakthrough technology to innovate new solutions
to overcome these challenges.</p>
<p>These technologies range from AI to reduce wait times and enhance preventative
care through personalised health plans, to the use of cloud technology
to scale vaccine operations and AR to assist with surgery.</p>
<p>Hear from technology giants, regional health systems and startups as they
examine the role of technology in transforming healthcare from a patient
and provider perspective, and what this would mean for the wider health
ecosystem going forward.</p>
