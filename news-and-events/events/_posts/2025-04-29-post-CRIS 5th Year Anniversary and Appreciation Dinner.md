<p>The CRIS 5<sup>th</sup> Year Anniversary and Appreciation Dinner recognised
the dedication and achievements of the collective effort over the past
five years in strengthening synergies and developing strategies to enhance
the clinical research and innovation landscape for Singapore.</p>
<p>Together with ecosystem partners and friends, we reflected on the milestones
achieved and renewed our commitment to building capabilities to support
our programmes. Our goal remains clear: to advance Singapore’s clinical
trials ecosystem, healthcare innovation, precision medicine, cancer and
cardiovascular research, and cell therapy manufacturing.</p>
<p>We also took the opportunity to express our heartfelt appreciation to
Professor John Lim for his contributions in establishing CRIS as a consortium
for the Ministry of Health’s national clinical research and translation
programmes.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, Professor Lim’s leadership has been instrumental
in overseeing the development of CRIS as a unified platform for national
clinical research and innovation efforts, growing our biomedical research
capabilities for the benefit of the healthcare ecosystem and economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a shared sense of purpose, we look ahead to the next chapter of shaping
clinical research that will deliver impact for both researchers and patients
in Singapore.</p>

<p>As part of our 5<sup>th</sup> year anniversary fringe activities on 16
April 2025, staff were invited to pen down words of encouragement to colleagues
on special edition CRIS 5th anniversary postcards. Beyond a simple postcard,
their messages to one another were a recognition of the dedication poured
into our programmes, and shared commitment to shaping clinical research
and translation collectively to advance healthcare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wrapping up the exchange with a fun twist, staff were also given a pouch
of five stones which represent the building blocks and milestones that
have enabled CRIS and our programmes to thrive. Each trinket contains a
collectible fun fact about CRIS and serves as a reminder that everyone
has played a part to enable the collective success at CRIS.</p>
