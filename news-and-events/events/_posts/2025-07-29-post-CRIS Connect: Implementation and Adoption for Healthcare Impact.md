<p>Dr Esther Leeâ€™s role entails nurturing healthcare innovations from ideation
to implementation. This requires coordination with stakeholders across
the healthcare ecosystem that spans providers, policymakers to investors.
Healthcare innovators and their relentless desire to continually improve
and create impact for the healthcare system drives her to support innovation,
development, commercialisation and adoption of new technologies into clinical
practice.</p>
<p>Prior to joining NHIC, Dr Lee served in SingHealth (SHHQ) focusing on
ground-up innovation which entailed nurturing handshakes to create conditions
and processes for innovation. She led a team to facilitate partnerships
thru co-developing innovation with start-ups, SMEs (funded by Enterprise
Singapore) and Institutes of Higher Learning, making such partnerships
accessible to innovators. This also included developing frameworks and
enablers to facilitate implementation and adoption of co-developed innovation.</p>
<p>Dr Le has also managed a local SME, which manufactures livestock feed
additives, with a distribution network overseas. This presented an opportunity
for Dr Lee to develop business analytical, operational experience in ISO
certification, distributor networks and import/export licensing. Dr Lee
has gleaned valuable experience in tech transfer at the NUS Industry Liaison
Office, managing an intellectual property portfolio in biochemistry, bioengineering
as well as contract negotiations covering material transfer, collaborations
and licensing.</p>
