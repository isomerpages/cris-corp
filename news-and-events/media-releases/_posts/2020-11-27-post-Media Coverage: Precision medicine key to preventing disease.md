Through analysis of one’s genes, precision medicine (PM) will allow us to determine an individual’s risk of developing diseases and allow for early intervention. 

At a webinar yesterday, Professor Tan Chorh Chuan, the chief health scientist of the Ministry of Health and executive director of its Office for Healthcare Transformation, cited that achieving this would be a central outcome of Singapore’s precision medicine programme.

Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) was incorporated to coordinate a whole-of-government effort to implement Phase II of Singapore’s 10-year precision medicine strategy. PRECISE will support the responsible use of PM in clinical applications relevant to Singapore, for the benefit of our patients and researchers.
