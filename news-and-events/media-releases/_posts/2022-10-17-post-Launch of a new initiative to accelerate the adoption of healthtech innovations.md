<p>Projects selected can expect to receive funding of up to S$1 million each.
The initiative is supported by the&nbsp;Ministry of Health and covers three
clinical adoption themes: Screening, Diagnostics and Monitoring, and Intervention.
The grant call for the first theme will open in November 2022.</p>

<p>The Clinical Innovation and Adoption Initiative is part of the expansion
of NHIC’s programmes to offer a holistic suite of support to power the
development and adoption of healthtech innovations in Singapore, and facilitate
their eventual commercialisation and scaling in and beyond Singapore, so
as to ensure the cost-effectiveness of these innovations through economies
of scale.</p>

</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, medical innovation has made great strides to
improve clinical management and hospital processes. This has played a key
role in improving efficiency, increasing productivity, and optimising care
for patients. However, despite such advances, challenges remain in the
transition from technology innovations to widespread clinical adoption
as standard of care in healthcare.</p>
<p>A new global landscape&nbsp;study&nbsp;found that only 10 to 30 per cent
of healthtech innovations are clinically adopted in a widespread manner.
The study – based on a survey of approximately 100 key opinion leaders
across Australia, Israel, Singapore, UK and the US – also highlighted the
need for a clearer pathway for new innovations in digital health, medical
devices and therapeutics to be adopted clinically.&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>New initiative to accelerate adoption of healthtech innovations</strong></h5>
<p>To keep Singapore at the forefront of clinical innovation and improve
the adoption rates of potentially life-saving health technologies that
benefit the population in Singapore, the National Health Innovation Centre
(NHIC) is launching a Clinical Innovation and Adoption Initiative to nurture
promising and cost-effective healthtech projects for adoption across the
healthcare clusters in Singapore to enhance healthcare delivery and patient
care. By developing local capabilities and platforms, Singapore will be
better positioned to attract international talents and capabilities, and
continuously improve our provision of healthcare and health.</p>
<p>Under this new initiative, projects selected can expect to receive funding
of up to S$1 million, subject to the scale and complexity of each project.
NHIC will also work closely with the project teams to provide strategic
guidance on regulatory policies and assist innovators along their commercialisation
journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initiative, supported by the Ministry of Health (MOH), will cover
three clinical adoption themes: Screening, Diagnostics and Monitoring,
and Intervention. The grant call for the first theme will open in November
2022.&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Holistic suite of programmes to power healthtech innovations in Singapore</strong></h5>
<p>Since its formation in 2014, the NHIC has expanded over the years under
the funding support from MOH’s National Medical Research Council, and developed
a robust track record in turning innovative healthcare research into commercial
enterprises and products that improve patient care and healthcare delivery.
In 2020, NHIC was&nbsp;consolidated as a business unit under the Consortium
for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS)&nbsp;to facilitate
synergies across the key national R&amp;D, and clinical translation and
service initiatives under MOH. With the repositioning of NHIC as an integral
part of CRIS, the centre has refreshed its brand identity&nbsp;and expanded
its programmes accordingly.</p>
<p>In addition to the Clinical Innovation and Adoption Initiative, NHIC will
be establishing more public-private partnerships, especially at the early
stages of the healthtech commercialisation journey. This includes the areas
of venture co-creation and technology development, and the nurturing of
tri-competent healthtech talent.&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Venture co-creation and technology development partnerships</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NHIC will be partnering with Origgin Ventures and Trinity Innovation Bioventure
Singapore respectively, to co-create medtech and biotech start-ups arising
from home-grown, cost-effective technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NHIC will also be working with Roche and MiRXES to establish open innovation
partnerships to explore potential co-development opportunities for clinically
and commercially impactful healthtech projects from an early stage.</p>
<p>By working closely with private sector partners from the initial stages
of product development, clinician innovators will be able to identify viable
commercial pathways for their healthtech innovations early on, and avoid
downstream challenges of “technology-push” type innovations where the commercial
value of the innovations may not be apparent to the users.</p>
<p>These collaborations play to the respective strengths of the public and
private sectors; NHIC would identify and support the achievement of healthcare
objectives, while private sector partners would introduce the commercial
discipline that prepares the projects to create innovations that are market-ready
and investable.&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Nurturing tri-competent healthtech talent</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>NHIC will partner SGInnovate to nurture founders and senior innovation
project leads with tri-competent capabilities in clinical, technical and
commercial experience in the biotech and medtech sectors.</p>
<p>This talent development programme will groom innovators who could assume
positions as future founders of home-grown biotech or medtech start-ups,
or become innovation leaders at larger biotech and medtech companies.</p>
<p>These talents in-residence will have the opportunity to immerse themselves
in real-world environments, both in public and private sector settings,
to experience how to design, develop and bring clinical innovations to
market. More information about this programme will be shared at a later
date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The NHIC now offers a more holistic suite of support to power product
ideation, technology development, clinical adoption and commercialisation
of healthtech innovations in Singapore. We appreciate our partners for
the support over the years and look forward to greater collaborations ahead.&nbsp;It
is but the start of an exciting journey and together, we shall continue
to forge ahead and break new grounds to&nbsp;power the next generation
of healthcare innovations,” said Professor Tina Wong, Executive Director,
NHIC.</p>
