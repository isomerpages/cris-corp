description: A ground-breaking study conducted by the Yong Loo Lin School of
  Medicine, NUH and Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI), found that a
  TB treatment strategy with an initial 8-week treatment period followed by
  retreatment of a small minority who were not cured, showed the same efficacy
  level as the standard 6-month treatment, but halved the average total time on
  treatment.
