We are heartened to have had Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Health, grace the launch. "Together, let’s unlock the potential of cell and gene therapy to forge a brighter and healthier future for Singapore and the world,” expressing his anticipation for the possibilities the facility will bring forth to our healthcare landscape and patients.  
   
The facility will pave the way towards improving the efficiency of cell therapy manufacturing by:  

* Driving the development of home-grown, high-quality cell therapy products from research institutes   
* Leveraging cutting-edge R&D technologies, state-of-the-art equipment and a skilled workforce to ensure a consistent and scalable manufacturing process  
* Positioning Singapore as a clinical trial hub through strategic partnerships with biotech companies and strong government support  

At the heart of this transformative journey lies an enhanced CGT ecosystem. 

We look forward to the ground-breaking work at ACTRIS that will advance cancer treatment and regenerative medicine, and make a difference in the lives of patients.
