In the article, CRIS CEO and ACTRIS Interim Executive Director A/Prof Danny Soon discussed how cell therapy can be a lifeline to patients who have failed conventional treatments for aggressive leukaemia and lymphoma.  
  
ACTRIS Chief Medical Officer Dr Francesca Lim also spoke about potential applications of cell therapy for degenerative conditions such as rheumatoid athritis and solid organ tumours.  
  
In August, we opened Singapore's largest national cell therapy facility, boosting Singapore's cell and gene therapy (CGT) capabilities, and allowing patients to gain quicker access to life-saving therapies.  
  
As we continue our work in advancing the CGT space in Singapore, stories like that of Mdm Fung serve as a reminder of the profound impact this work can have.
