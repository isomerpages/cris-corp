<h3>PRECISE and IHCC Collaborate to Host Conference Advancing Global Precision Medicine Research</h3>
<hr>
<p>Our programme, Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE), in collaboration
with the International Health Cohorts Consortium (IHCC), hosted the PRECISE-IHCC
Conference themed “From Cohorts to Clinics: The New Landscape of Global
Healthcare,” on 21 August 2024.</p>
<p>The PRECISE-IHCC Conference, the first of its kind in Southeast Asia,
plays a vital role in the rapidly growing field of large-scale genomics
and population-based programmes. With over 50 speakers from Singapore and
abroad, the conference provided a platform to spotlight Singapore’s and
the international community’s advancements in precision medicine and sharing
of insights. This three-day conference has gathered some 600 thought leaders,
clinicians, scientists, biotechs, and patient advocacy groups from around
the world who are at the forefront of precision medicine and public health
innovation.</p>
