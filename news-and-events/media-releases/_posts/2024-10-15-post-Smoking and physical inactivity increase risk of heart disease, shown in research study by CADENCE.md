<p>In Singapore, heart disease remains a top cause of death. On average,
34 people have heart attacks and 24 people die from cardiovascular disease
daily. With a rapidly ageing population, these numbers are expected to
increase. In particular, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD)
are increasingly becoming a global health challenge. ASCVD in Southeast
Asia is also reported to manifest at a younger age, with 64% of patients
being under the age of 65.</p>

<p>In the next phase of the study, CADENCE plans to work closely with its

to map out potential intervention strategies at population level to encourage

<p><strong>SINGAPORE – 17 OCTOBER 2024</strong>  <strong>– </strong>Findings
from a research study, Al4HealthyCities-SG, led by CADENCE in partnership
with the Novartis Foundation’s Al4HealthyCities initiative, found that
smoking and physical inactivity are major contributors to cardiovascular
disease risks among Singaporeans.These findings shed light on a pressing
health challenge and provide crucial insights to inform targeted interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Heart Disease is a leading cause of death in Singapore</strong>
</p>
<p>Heart disease remains a leading cause of death in Singapore. On average,
34 people have heart attacks and 24 people die from cardiovascular disease
daily. As the population ages, this problem is expected to worsen. Notably,
atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) are increasingly affecting
younger individuals in Southeast Asia, with 64% of patients under the age
of 65. The situation is expected to worsen from 482 cases of heart attacks
per 100,000 population in Singapore in 2025 to 1,418 per 100,000 population
by 2050, representing a nearly three-fold increase.</p>
<p><strong>Findings of AI4HealthyCities-SG study</strong>
</p>
<p>The Novartis Foundation’s population health programme AI4HealthyCities
harnesses data, technology, and artificial intelligence to tackle heart
health inequities in urban areas. Through Singapore’s participation in
the initiative led by CADENCE, the AI4HealthyCities-SG study will provide
deeper insights into the drivers behind cardiovascular disease among the
local population.</p>
<p>The study specifically examined the influence of social determinants of
health (SDoH) on cardiovascular health and disease outcomes among the local
population, including diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure,
and overall health. SDoH are the non-medical factors that influence health
outcomes, such as the environment where individuals live, and the community
where they work and engage.</p>
<p>The study draws insights from the data of the Singapore Multi-Ethnic Cohort
Phase 1 (MEC1) study, which examined the risk of cardiovascular disease
among participants of Chinese, Indian, and Malay descent over several years.
Aside from the MEC1 dataset, the Singapore data analysts on the AI4HealthyCities-SG
study are also examining datasets from the Singapore Myocardial Infarction
Registry (SMIR) which tracks the incidence of heart attack cases in Singapore,
the Singapore Cardiac Longitudinal Outcome Database (SingCLOUD) Study,
a research project initiated by National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS),
and the National Diabetes Database.</p>
<p>The analysis highlighted that interventions specifically targeting smoking
and low physical activity have the most significant impact on lowering
the risk of CVD. This partially mediates the impact of education, housing,
and income on cardiovascular outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for a future-ready healthcare system</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the study, CADENCE will look towards leveraging technology
to enhance clinical research, evidence-based decision-making, and care
delivery while empowering individuals to adopt healthier lifestyles. By
implementing proactive interventions in preventive healthcare, the population
can take control of their health, resulting in longer and healthier lives.</p>
<p>In the next phase of the study, CADENCE plans to collaborate with public
healthcare institutions and the community to develop intervention strategies
at several community-wide initiatives to promote and encourage healthier
lifestyle habits, increased physical activity, improved dietary choices,
and smoking cessation programmes.</p>
<p>The AI4HealthyCities-SG study aims to serve as a regional blueprint by
informing other nations about effective interventions that positively impact
population health, by tapping into insights from this research.</p>
<p>“By designing a population health system with care integration at its
core, we aim to leverage AI-driven insights to transform our approach into
one that is proactive, predictive and preventive. As Singapore’s healthcare
system transitions to one that supports the local population in making
healthier life choices, this improves clinical care delivery, empowers
patients and improves health outcomes,” said Prof Derek Hausenloy, Executive
Director, CADENCE.</p>
<p>“As the first Asian country under the umbrella of AI4HealthyCities, we
hope to be a regional blueprint that will help other nations make informed
decisions about how to target health resources towards interventions that
can positively impact population health,” Prof Hausenloy added.</p>
<p>“The Novartis Foundation is excited to support Singapore's vision for
better heart health through our cardiovascular population health initiative
AI4HealthyCities. In close collaboration with a consortium of academic
partners under the lead of CADENCE, AI4HealthyCities leverages the country’s
excellent data ecosystem and advanced analytics capabilities to identify
the strongest drivers of cardiovascular health. Our goal is to inform predictive,
proactive, and preventative population health roadmaps to address risk
factors with precise interventions and further promote Singapore’s transition
from care to health,” said Dr Ann Aerts, Head of Novartis Foundation.</p>

<p><strong>About CADENCE</strong>
</p>
<p>Established in February 2023, the Cardiovascular Disease National Collaborative
Enterprise (CADENCE) is a national clinical translational programme aimed
at synergising cardiovascular research and technology capabilities across
Singapore.</p>
<p>Its goal is to integrate existing research capabilities, and bring together
the strongest basic, clinical, and translational talent and expertise across
Singapore and institutions, to establish a focused and impactful national
cardiovascular disease research and translational programme with world-class
peaks of excellence.</p>
<p>To achieve this, CADENCE has established four national joint platforms
focused on data science, clinical trials, and artificial intelligence/digital
health, together with a business intelligence and development unit to attract
industry collaborations/external investments.</p>
<p>CADENCE is a programme of the <a href="https://cris.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore</a> (CRIS).
CADENCE is supported by the Singapore Ministry of Health through the National
Medical Research Council (NMRC) Office, MOH Holdings Pte Ltd under the
NMRC RIE2025 National Clinical Translational Programme Funding Initiative
(MOH-001277).</p>
