<p>• Cardiovascular Disease National Collaborative Enterprise (CADENCE) and
Medera announce the initiation of Asia’s first multi-centre gene therapy
clinical trial for heart failure, with Singapore being the first and only
site selected outside of the United States (US).</p>
<p>• In Singapore, about 2.5% of Singaporeans aged 60 years old or above
have heart failure. The condition is often the result of ischaemic heart
disease, which contributes to around 20% of deaths here. Southeast Asian
patients tend to present with heart failure at a younger age (mean age
of 54 years) than those in the Western population (mean age of 75 years).</p>
<p>• Developed by Medera Inc. (“Merdera”)’s solely owned subsidiary Sardocor,
the gene therapy product SRD-001, an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based
gene therapy, can potentially improve the pumping action of the heart muscle.
This therapy is intended to treat patients with heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction (HFrEF), which accounts for half of all heart failure
cases worldwide. SRD-001 has received an Investigational New Drug (IND)
clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
<p>• This trial marks the first collaboration between Singapore's two national
heart centres National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS), National University
Heart Centre Singapore (NUHCS) and with Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH).</p>

<p><strong>SINGAPORE – 19 November 2024 </strong>– The Cardiovascular Disease
National Collaborative Enterprise (CADENCE) and Medera Inc. (“Merdera”)’s
Sardocor are pleased to announce the initiation of a ground-breaking clinical
trial for a novel gene therapy product aimed at treating heart failure.
This marks the first multi-centre gene therapy trial in Asia for heart
failure, with Singapore being the first and only site selected outside
of the United States (US) for this significant translational breakthrough.
Heart failure is a global challenge, with Singapore facing a particularly
high burden. About 2.5% of Singaporeans aged 60 years old or above have
heart failure. The condition is often the result of <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/resources-statistics/singapore-health-facts/principal-causes-of-death" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ischaemic heart disease, which contributes to around 20% of deaths in Singapore</a>.
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6410537/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Southeast Asian patients tend to present with heart failure at a younger
age (mean age of 54 years) than those in the Western population (mean age
of 75 years)</a>. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6410537/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Furthermore, they tend to present with more severe conditions which require intensive care, longer length of hospital stay, and a higher hospital mortality rate</a>.</p>
<p>Developed by Medera’s solely owned subsidiary Sardocor, the gene therapy
product SRD-001 can potentially improve the pumping action of the heart
muscle, reduce symptoms and signs of heart failure, and reduce the risk
of hospital re-admissions. SRD-001 is intended to treat patients with heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).</p>

highlighting its potential as a new first-in-human treatment option for
patients afflicted with different types of HF. SRD-001/2/3 employs an adeno-associated
virus-based gene therapy, delivered directly to cardiac ventricular muscle
cells via Sardocor’s proprietary intracoronary infusion system.</p>
<p>Furthermore, clinical dosages have been optimised by the Human mini-Heart®
technology developed by Novoheart, another solely owned subsidiary of Medera,
in accordance with the FDA Modernisation Act 2.0. <a href="https://www.singhealthdukenus.com.sg/news/research/national-heart-centre-singapore-partners-mederas-novoheart-to-develop-asias-first-bioengineered-human-heart-in-a-jar-with-heart-failure-for-precision-medicine" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">On 21 November 2023, the National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS) announced a partnership with Novoheart to develop Asia’s first bioengineered human heart-in-a-jar with heart failure for precision medicine</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>This trial marks the first collaboration between Singapore's two national
heart centres (NHCS and NUHCS), and with TTSH. This is a testament to the
country’s robust cardiovascular research infrastructure. It also highlights
CADENCE’s efforts in streamlining clinical trial processes across these
institutions. This includes streamlining contracting procedures, simplifying
the costs of conducting cardiovascular clinical trials across these sites,
as well as providing a centralised point of-contact for companies looking
to conduct clinical trials and bring novel therapies to Singapore.</p>
<p>Professor Roger Hajjar, MD, President and co-founder of Medera, expressed
enthusiasm about the trial's launch: "Medera and Sardocor are very excited
to initiate this trial in Singapore, the first site outside of the US,
by deploying this cutting-edge technology for the first time ever to Asian
heart failure patients. Sardocor’s unique regulated intracoronary delivery
methodology is a minimally invasive procedure that targets the heart directly,
designed to minimise drug dosage and therefore side-effects while preserving
efficacy. While the Singapore trial’s initial focus is on congestive heart
failure, this foundation will enable subsequent expansion to other cardiac
indications."</p>
<p>Adding to the significance of this trial, Professor Derek Hausenloy, Executive
Director of CADENCE, and Director of the National Heart Research Institute
Singapore at NHCS, remarked:</p>
<p>"The launch of the SRD-001 trial in Singapore is a landmark moment for
cardiovascular cell and gene therapy research in Asia. It underscores our
commitment to integrate cutting-edge research and technologies to combat
cardiovascular diseases. By bringing together the best of our national
research capabilities and expertise, we aim to pave the way for innovative
treatments that can significantly improve patient outcomes. This trial
not only highlights Singapore’s position as a leader in cardiovascular
research but also showcases our potential to contribute to the global fight
against heart failure."</p>
<p>“Medera is extremely delighted to partner with Singapore’s cardiac experts
from the public healthcare institutions in its first efforts in Asia to
comprehensively cover important areas from mini-Heart® based drug discovery
all the way to clinical gene therapy starting with SRD-001 for the benefit
of the large number of Asian heart patients,” said Professor Ronald Li,
PhD, CEO and co-founder of Medera.</p>
