<h3><strong>CRIS honours five years of visionary leadership by Chairman Professor John Lim, welomes Professor Kenneth Mak as new Chairman</strong></h3>
<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 14 May 2025 </strong>– The Consortium for Clinical
Research and Innovation, Singapore&nbsp; (CRIS) is pleased to announce
the appointment of Professor Kenneth Mak as our new Chairman,&nbsp; effective
15 May 2025. We extend our heartfelt appreciation to Professor John Lim
for his&nbsp; contributions as our founding Chairman and visionary leadership.
This transition marks an exciting&nbsp; new chapter for CRIS, as the organisation
builds on five years of transformative progress under&nbsp; the leadership
of outgoing Chairman, Professor Lim.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 2020, CRIS has played a pivotal role in advancing
R&amp;D and innovation&nbsp; efforts in the Singapore biomedical sector.
The organisation brings together six national&nbsp; programmes to advance
Singapore’s clinical trials ecosystem, healthcare innovation, precision&nbsp;
medicine, cancer and cardiovascular research, and cell and gene therapy
manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>CRIS would like to extend our heartfelt appreciation to Professor John
Lim for his contributions in&nbsp; repurposing the Singapore Clinical Research
Institute to establish CRIS as a consortium for the&nbsp; Ministry of Health’s
national clinical research and translation programmes. Over the past five&nbsp;
years, Professor Lim’s visionary leadership has been instrumental in overseeing
the development&nbsp; of CRIS as a unified platform for national clinical
research and innovation efforts, as well as the&nbsp; expansion and increasing
impact of its six national programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>His strategic vision and unwavering commitment have helped shaped the
CRIS identity and foster&nbsp; strong partnerships across public health
institutions and industry stakeholders. Professor Lim’s&nbsp; leadership
has been crucial in championing key initiatives in health innovation and
impactful research, as well as identifying key areas of alignment and collaboration
opportunities across&nbsp;CRIS’ six programmes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During Professor Lim’s tenure, programmes within CRIS achieved significant
milestones:</p>
<p>• Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore (ACTRIS): Officially
set up in 2023 as the national cell and gene therapy facility to support
the research, translation and manufacturing of cell, tissue and gene therapy
products by bringing together players from research institutes, healthcare
institutions and the industry. It has recently received its Manufacturer’s
Licence and achieved Good Manufacturing Practice accreditation from the
Health Sciences Authority in 2025.</p>
<p>• Cardiovascular Disease National Collaborative Enterprise (CADENCE):
Launched the Asia-Pacific Cardiovascular Research Network in 2025, and
secured 16 academic and industry collaborations in two years since its
set up and incorporation as a national cardiovascular research and translation
programme within CRIS in 2023.</p>
<p>• National Health Innovation Centre Singapore (NHIC): Initiated key programmes
to identify and smoothen barriers in implementation and adoption of healthcare
innovations that could bring benefits across the healthcare ecosystem,
such as the Innovation to Adopt scheme, Clinical Advancement and Development
for Research, Entrepreneurship and Enterprise, and the Helix Immersion
Programme for C-suites executives. Since inception, NHIC has supported
over 100 innovation projects, leading to over 70 licences and creation
of 27 spinoffs that attracted over $90 million in investments.</p>
<p>• Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE): Together with programme
partners, created one of Asia’s most diverse Asian genomic datasets, spearheaded
the development of predictive healthcare pathways for selected diseases
significant to Asian populations, enhanced public-private enterprise collaborations
for 11 companies and powered seven local start-ups in Singapore.</p>
<p>• Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI): Facilitated collaborative
clinical research for more than 150 clinical trials, supported 12 disease-focused
clinical research networks and launched several talent development initiatives
including the National Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC) Learning and
Development Initiative which has trained over 400 CRCs since 2017.</p>
<p>• Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium (STCC): Strengthened biobanking
and cancer research through collaborations with the Victorian Cancer Biobank
and Roche to advance precision oncology.</p>
<p>Professor Kenneth Mak is Director-General of Health at the Ministry of
Health, where he oversees the organisation and delivery of health services
in Singapore. Professor Mak works closely with Singapore’s Regional Health
Systems and healthcare institutions on care integration as well as on Singapore’s
long-term healthcare transformation strategy.</p>
<p>Professor Mak brings with him a wealth of experience in healthcare leadership.
In addition to the new appointment as Board Chairman for CRIS, Professor
Mak serves as Board Chairman for the Communicable Diseases Agency. He also
serves on the Governing Board of the National University Health System
as well as on the Governing Boards of Nanyang Technological University’s
Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and the Duke-NUS Medical School. Professor
Mak is Registrar of the Singapore Medical Council, which regulates the
practice of medical practitioners in Singapore.</p>
<p>Professor Mak said, “I am honoured to join CRIS at this pivotal juncture
and would like to thank Professor John Lim for laying a strong foundation
over the past five years. I look forward to working with the team to further
strengthen Singapore’s clinical research capabilities to benefit the healthcare
ecosystem. Together, we will continue to create synergies and value-add
to the healthcare system, bridge the gap between scientific breakthroughs
and healthcare impact, and harness the economic benefits of our research
and translation efforts.”</p>
<p>As CRIS embarks on our next chapter under Professor Mak’s leadership,
the organisation will remain committed to supporting and enabling national-level
clinical research and translation programmes to advance Singapore’s healthcare
research and innovation capabilities. By fostering collaboration across
public and private sectors, CRIS will continue to enable cutting-edge research,
accelerate translational efforts, and drive impactful economic value capture
and healthcare outcomes.</p>
