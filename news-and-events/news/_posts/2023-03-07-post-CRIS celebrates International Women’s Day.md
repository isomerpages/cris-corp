This International Women's Day, we spotlight six remarkable women from CRIS and its programmes who are committed and passionate about advancing clinical research and innovation in their respective areas of expertise. 

These range from spearheading cell therapy and precision medicine programmes; expanding the reach of clinical research networks; driving innovation and enterprise for healthcare; setting up robust legal frameworks; and shaping corporate direction through strategy and planning.

Their bravery in stepping out of their comfort zones, resilience and passion will have far-reaching impact on the nation’s healthcare research ecosystem. 

We hope their stories will inspire women everywhere to pursue their dreams, defy limitations, and believe they can create lasting impact no matter where they are.
