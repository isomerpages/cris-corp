*Cancer care has changed dramatically in the past few years following the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of researchers everywhere is to develop more advanced and targeted treatments, such that patients may experience better outcomes and higher survival rates.*
  
*To mark World Cancer Research Day, we caught up with Dr Michal Marek Hoppe, a data analyst at our programme, the [Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium](https://stcc.sg) (STCC) and joint fellow at CSI Singapore.*

Michal has over 15 years of experience in biomedical and translational cancer research. Prior to joining STCC, he has been contributing actively to ground-breaking cancer research as a joint fellow at the Cancer Science Institute of Singapore (CSI Singapore). Together with his team led by Dr Anand Jeyasekharan, Principal Investigator and Facility Head (Microscopy and Multiplex Assays Core), CSI Singapore, they discovered a breakthrough novel approach for predicting resistance against cancer therapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). They embarked on the project in 2018 and the results were recently published in [Cancer Discovery](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/13/5/1144/726201/Patterns-of-Oncogene-Coexpression-at-Single-Cell), the flagship journal of the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR).\[1\]

  
DLBCL is the most common type of blood cancer globally and in Singapore. A combination of chemo-immunotherapy drugs, known as R-CHOP, is commonly recommended as a first-line treatment for DLBCL \[2\]. However, when patients do not respond to these standard therapies or experience a relapse, they are unlikely to respond to other forms of treatment. Their prospects for alternative treatment options become starkly limited. \[3\] Hence, there is a need to identify patients who are likely to exhibit resistance to standard therapies early, such that more effective treatment modalities can be sought for them sooner.
