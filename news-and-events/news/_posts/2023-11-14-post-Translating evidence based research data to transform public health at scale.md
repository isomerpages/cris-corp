***In a fast-paced digital age, ground-breaking research discoveries about innovative therapies, medtech advancements and new diagnostic capabilities for healthcare are announced every day.***

***These developments offer hope to patients, especially when living longer can present healthcare challenges, such as increased incidence of chronic diseases, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and heart disease.***  

         
##### **Delivering value-based care and outcomes**

As these advancements become available, healthcare systems around the world now face a new era of decision-making: How can healthcare providers utilise these cutting-edge innovations in a way that will still deliver value-based care and outcomes?

To support effective healthcare decision-making, there is a community of professionals highly skilled in using sophisticated analytical tools to crunch through large-scale datasets, unpack data and generate useful insights. This area of expertise is known as health economics and outcomes research (HEOR), and it is a relatively new area that has emerged more prominently over the past few years.

Today, HEOR has potential for far-reaching positive impact on public health especially as healthcare systems continue to seek ways to stay sustainable for the future.

HEOR not only assesses the affordability and sustainability of health expenditure, but also draws links between treatment and actual outcomes in research patient cohorts to ensure evidence-based guidance on how to improve care at scale.
      
##### **HEOR efforts in diabetes care**
      
On this front, the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI) has a team of Epidemiologists passionate about HEOR and who have been supporting research projects in areas such as diabetics management, primary care and health technology assessment (HTA), among others.

To mark **World Diabetes Day**, we spotlight two research projects that SCRI’s HEOR team is collaborating with the National Healthcare Group Pharmacy (NHGPh) and National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP).

Senior Epidemiologist Dr Yoko Wong is working on the first project that looks into a more accurate way to calculate and determine medication adherence among patients with Type 2 diabetes. For the second project, Senior Epidemiologist Dr Guo Liang is studying the potential impact of weight reduction in reversing Type 2 diabetes.

Their sharp data analytic skills will help transform data gathered from fieldwork into ground-breaking insights that determine the impact of the research outcomes.

##### **Diabetes in Singapore**

In Singapore, more than 400,000 people are living with diabetes, and of that number, 220,000 people are living with Type 2 diabetes <sup>[1]</sup>.
       

Type 2 diabetes is often managed through medication to improve and regulate the blood sugar levels of a person with diabetes. However, about one in three of the people living with diabetes are not adhering to their medication<sup>[2]</sup>. This can be attributed in part to their doubts about the safety and efficacy of the medication, or them feeling well or having no visible signs of the disease.

Poor adherence to diabetes medication such as glucose-lowering drugs can result in poor control of blood sugar levels, increasing the risk of serious complications such as kidney failure, heart attack or stroke.

Medication adherence is thus a complex challenge for patients managing Type 2 diabetes. Key factors that determine medication adherence vary, ranging from patient education and practical methods such as setting reminders to take their medication.

##### **1. Medication adherence study by National Healthcare Group Pharmacy (NHGPh)/National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP) (supported by SCRI)**

In this research study by lead investigator, Yap Hui Rei, Senior Pharmacist at NHGPh, retrospective research was done across five NHG polyclinics to study the medication adherence of 789 patients who were receiving regular care at these polyclinics.

The study gathered the data of anti-diabetes medication that was prescribed and dispensed to these patients from July 2016. The study continued to track the medication prescription and dispensing records till end of June 2017.
  
##### **Calculating medication adherence**

Proportion of Days covered (PDC) is a method used internationally to measure medication adherence from electronic medical records. PDC is used by healthcare teams, pharmacists and researchers to assess the quality of care and the clinical outcomes of patients. It is commonly calculated as a percentage by dividing the sum of days covered by medication over the designated measurement period. A common threshold for adequate adherence is if the patient consumed at least 80 per cent of the medication supplied.

“Being able to identify sub-optimal medication adherence early and accurately will help medical teams, including doctors, pharmacists and diabetes care nurses identify patients at risk for treatment failure and provide early interventions,” said Hui Rei.

“Currently, there is no standardised approach to calculate and report PDC,” she added.

Together with her team of researchers, Hui Rei developed a series of new algorithm models to quantify medication adherence using prescribed and dispensed records to generate various scores of PDC. Next, the study sought to introduce an appropriate method for PDC calculation specifically tailored to the Singapore context. In this collaboration, Dr Wong further analysed the research data and translated the insights to support in-depth research.

***Valuable data mining***
 
Dr Wong shared that data cleaning “can be tedious” because it involves trawling through volumes of data and identifying important ones for further analysis. &nbsp;Yet she derives “joy from the knowledge and understanding gained from studying the data, and how dealing with real world data can lead to more evidence-based findings to impact health outcomes of patients living with diabetes.”

For this project with PI Hui Rei, Dr Wong discovered that not all anti-diabetic medications are prescribed for the full duration of the measurement period, and suggested to the PI that this might be a significant factor to explore in her research. Dr Wong also highlighted that the pattern of dispensation and prescription in the Singapore context was different from other countries.
       
“In the polyclinics in Singapore, medication is subsidised so patients are more likely to collect all the medication prescribed and hence, the ratio between prescribed and dispensed medication is very close,” said Dr Wong, who holds a PhD in Genetic and Molecular Epidemiology (GAME) and a Master’s degree in Public Health.

After running comparisons on the data, Dr Wong was able to advise Hui Rei on the next steps of her research journey, for example, how the data can be interpreted or the various ways that the data can be further analysed and reported.

**Data-driven insights**

Through this study, the preliminary analysis showed promising results. This research would pave the way for further research to validate the assumptions for different PDC algorithms.  In the long run, it is hoped that such algorithms offer better accuracy for tracking medication adherence and patients can benefit from more timely interventions in managing their diabetes with sustained quality of life for many years to come.
