This has been a remarkable year for CRIS and our programmes.

#### **Unveiling the CRIS values – Respect, Integrity, Collaboration, and Excellence** 

This year, the launch of our CRIS Values in July marked a significant milestone.

We first embarked on a Culture Journey in October 2022, where staff shared their thoughts on our core values and forged a stronger CRIS identity. Leaders from across our programmes also gathered to crystalise the discussion and co-created our CRIS Values – **Respect, Integrity, Collaboration, Excellence (RICE)**. 

These values will guide us towards our common goal of keeping Singapore at the forefront of clinical and translational research innovation, while actively advancing the sustainability and quality of Singapore’s healthcare system.

Staff also participated actively in several events and activities throughout the year, which reinforced our organisational values. 

During our first-ever **CRIS Family Day** in March this year, more than 50 staff gathered with family and pets in tow for an afternoon of fun and games at Labrador Park, including a “CRIS Amazing Race” and a heartwarming BBQ dinner by the sea!

In September, over 70 CRIS employees came together to unleash their culinary creativity at a **cooking workshop** at Palette Sensations. Staff teamed up to craft a three-course meal and enjoyed their fruits of labour after the session. What made this session even more special was the unique activity of crafting food sculptures that symbolised our CRIS Values.

Culminating the year was our very first **Dinner &amp; Dance** in November. Various groups across our programmes also showcased their intricate costumes and theatrical talents by reenacting memorable scenes from movies.

##### **Celebrating excellence in medical research and showcasing innovation**

This year at the National Medical Research Council (NMRC) Awards Ceremony and Research Symposium, held on 27 and 28 April, CRIS met representatives from across the academic and clinical research community, including those from funding agencies, venture investment and healthcare research.

At our booth, we shared more about the various ways in which CRIS and our programmes provide a leading edge for clinician researchers, innovators, medtech and healthtech talent in Singapore to advance and develop their capabilities in clinical research and translation.

Additionally, three of the [National Healthcare Innovation Centre Singapore](https://www.nhic.sg) (NHIC)'s portfolio companies FathomX, PROMinsight, and EyRIS showcased their innovations to the clinical and research community.

Heartiest congratulations to awardees from CRIS and valued members of our Board Oversight Committees, including Prof Derek Hausenloy, Prof Patrick Tan, A/Prof Toh Han Chong, A/Prof Ker Kan Tan, Prof Tai E Shyong, A/Prof Iain Tan, Dr Jason Chan and Dr Shir Lynn Lim on receiving their well-deserved awards at this event.

#### **Commemorating leadership transition, celebrating milestones, and powering healthtech innovation**

In January 2023, NHIC formally welcomed A/Prof Henry Ho as Executive Director and expressed appreciation for Prof Tina Wong for her dedication and guidance since 2017. Prof Tina’s leadership saw the launch of several successful programmes such as [I2Start](https://www.nhic.sg/funding/innovation-to-startup/), boosting innovative clinical technologies for Singapore.

A highlight of the appreciation and networking event was the lively “Lohei” and networking session, bringing together NHIC's Clinical Advancement and Development for Research Entrepreneurship and Enterprise (CADRE<sup>2</sup>) partners, healthcare innovators, government agencies, spin-off, and innovation offices. 

The gathering of industry professionals, united by their passion for healthtech, offered a platform for exchange of ideas and potential collaborations. An inspiring occasion for everyone involved.
