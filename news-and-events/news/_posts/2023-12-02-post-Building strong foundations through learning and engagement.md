*Winners of the Distinguished Contributor Award 2022*

The award recognises the significant contributions and dedication of CRCs to advance clinical research. In conjunction with the awards, SCRI also organised the SCRI-SingHealth CRC Webinar, where distinguished speakers spoke on the importance of a good study design in ensuring the quality of clinical trials.

The recipient of the Distinction award was Michelle Ren, Senior CRC from KK Women's and Children's Hospital. She coordinated a national COVID-19 vaccine study to ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for young children, and  overcame challenges together with her team to complete the recruitment of 150 subjects within three weeks.

#### **Empowering excellence: Training and education programmes for the clinical research industry**

The past year has been eventful for the team at the SCRI Academy. From organising national training programmes to developing specialised workshops, the team conducted and tailored courses to support fellow peers in the clinical research industry and equip them with the skills to better tackle their needs and challenges.

#### **PRECISE and Science Centre Singapore raises public awareness on precision medicine and genomics**

In collaboration with Science Centre Singapore, [Precision Health Research, Singapore](https://npm.sg) (PRECISE) organised a series of educational initiatives to spark interest and educate youths in precision medicine and genomics. 

On 15 April, a DNA forum was organised to mark the 70th Anniversary of the discovery of the DNA double helix, where members of the public learnt more about precision medicine and its benefits on the course of health and medicine. As part of the event, ISawtheScience (a blog by Science Centre Singapore) also spoke with Dr Seow Shih Wee, Director, Corporate Services at PRECISE, on how precision medicine may revolutionise the course of health and medicine .

*Highlights from the Genomic Forums which were co-hosted by PRECISE and Science Centre Singapore*

On 4 September, an [Understanding Genomics](https://blog.science.edu.sg/2023/09/04/understanding-genomics/) forum was held to enlighten the younger generation about the pivotal role genomics plays in maintaining health and causing disease. The speakers included Dr Seow, A/Prof Ng Kar Hui, Senior Consultant, Paediatric Kidney Transplantation Programme, National University Hospital, and A/Prof Joanne Ngeow, Head, Cancer Genetics Service, National Cancer Centre Singapore and Associate Professor of Genomic Medicine at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, NTU.

Some 60 secondary school, pre-tertiary and tertiary students attended the session and learnt about the positive outcomes of precision medicine, the significance of the [SG10K_Health](https://www.npm.sg/news-and-events/editorial-features/sg10k-discoveries-from-mapping-10000-genomes/) and [PRECISE-SG100K](https://www.npm.sg/news-and-events/editorial-features/sg100k-translating-insights-from-100000-genomic-data-sets/) studies, A/Prof Ng’s [Clinical Implementation Pilot](https://www.npm.sg/cip/) for primary glomerular diseases, and the importance of genetics in cancer prevention.

The final installment of the series on 4 November saw esteemed speakers Dr Seow, Dr Li Jingmei from Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)’s Genome Institute of Singapore and A/Prof Wee Hwee Lin from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore. They shared insights into the NPM programme, DNA sequencing and effects of medication and how our genes may influence the effects of our medication.
