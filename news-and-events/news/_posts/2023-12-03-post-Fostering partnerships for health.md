#### **Elevating Singapore's clinical research landscape**

Our team at the [Singapore Clinical Research Institute](https://scri.edu.sg) (SCRI) hosted several roundtable discussions this year, as part of their mission to enhance the standards of clinical research capabilities in Singapore. 

![SCRI roundtable EDB](/images/Resources\_News/231203%20Year%20in%20review/3\_1\_SCRI.png)

In June 2023, the SCRI CRO roundtable gathered some 60 partners from the clinical research ecosystem, where they announced plans to kickstart a Clinical Research Professionals association in Singapore to support, provide leadership, as well as drive research excellence for the clinical research community.

In August, the roundtable on Decentralised Clinical Trials drew over 70 clinical research professionals and featured a lively panel discussion with panellists from the Health Sciences Authority, Cardiovascular Disease National Collaborative Enterprise (CADENCE), and representatives from the Singapore Association of Pharmaceutical Industries (SAPI). 

The session also included updates on SCRI’s key initiatives to strengthen Singapore's clinical research ecosystem, including the master clinical trial agreement to reduce trial start-up time, and expansion of regional Clinical Research Networks.


#### **Advancing regional research and collaboration through Clinical Research Networks**

As part of SCRI's commitment to develop Clinical Research Networks (CRN) to enhance regional research partnerships, several significant initiatives were launched this year. 

SCRI supported the implementation of the ADVANcing Clinical Evidence in Infectious Diseases (ADVANCE-ID) Network, a regional research collaboration involving research networks and 30 hospitals across Asia.

*SCRI-PAROS Meeting in Philippines*

In April, a partnership was formed with the Philippines Pan Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) with Pre-hospital and Emergency Care (PEC) providers conducting research in the Asia Pacific region. In May, SCRI organised the Paediatric Acute and Critical Care Medicine Asian Network (PACCMAN) meeting in Phuket. The PACCMAN meeting comprised sharing sessions on paediatric trials and on current and upcoming PACCMAN studies, furthering the CRN’s aims to support and stimulate research in pediatric intensive care in Asia.


#### **STCC's first cross-border partnership with the Australian Victorian Cancer Biobank to empower biobanking and cancer research**

The [Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium](https://stcc.sg) (STCC) signed its first cross-border partnership with the Australian Victorian Cancer Biobank to foster collaborations in translational oncology research. 

![3.4 STCC VCB MOU](/images/Resources\_News/231203%20Year%20in%20review/3\_4\_STCC\_VCB\_MOU.png)

As part of the agreement, STCC and VCB will share its oncology specimen databases, allowing researchers to access a wider array of tissue samples for cancer research, cross-sharing of tissue banking best practices and establishing outreach programmes to advance clinical research collaborations between the two countries.

#### **Advancing Insights: STCC and Amgen embark on a Research Collaboration Agreement to study the biology of small cell lung cancer**

Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2020 globally, with 2.2 million new cases, accounting for 11.4% of cancers worldwide. In Singapore, lung cancer is also one of the three most frequently diagnosed cancer among patients, and is the leading cause of cancer deaths among males. Of these, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents approximately 10 to 15% of all lung cancer patients globally.

![3.6 STCC Amgen ](/images/Resources\_News/231203%20Year%20in%20review/3\_6\_STCC\_Amgen.jpg)

STCC and its institutional partners announced a collaboration with Amgen on a retrospective non-interventional study to better understand the biology of SCLC, using investigational tools that could expand the knowledge underpinning distinct molecular subtypes of SCLC to enable a targeted treatment approach.

This multi-centre retrospective non-interventional study will be conducted at the National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore General Hospital, and the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore.

#### **Fuelling healthcare innovation through NHIC's I2Start programme**

In 2023, NHIC and their partners Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research & Technology Centre and Enterprise Singapore conducted a series of "[Innovation to Startup](https://www.nhic.sg/funding/innovation-to-startup/)" (I2Start) grant roadshows across the institutes of higher learning and public healthcare clusters that received an overwhelming response of over 100 participants from the ecosystem.

![3.7 NHIC I2START](/images/Resources\_News/231203%20Year%20in%20review/3\_7\_NHIC.png)

I2Start is a streamlined funding scheme to support company formation around health and biomedical science innovations. One-on-one sessions were held to provide inputs on the feasibility of participant ideas, suitability of the grant scheme and the potential for commercialisation. 


#### **US FDA Commissioner Dr Robert Califf visits ACTRIS and held a scientific roundtabl**

The [Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore](https://actris.sg) (ACTRIS) was privileged to host US FDA Commissioner Dr Robert Califf for a laboratory tour.

#### **STCC meets with CancerModels.org**

The STCC team was thrilled to meet with [CancerModels.Org](https://www.cancermodels.org) to learn about the meaningful work which the organisation does to build an open-source and community-driven resource which standardises, integrates and publishes the complex and diverse data associated with patient-derived cancer xenografts, organoids and cell lines. 

![3.9 STCC x CancerModels.org](/images/Resources\_News/231203%20Year%20in%20review/3\_9\_STCC\_Cancermodels.jpg)

This initiative enables researchers and institutions from around the world to find and access patient derived cancer models, contribute to a shared knowledge pool, accelerate cancer research, and develop personalised cancer treatments. 

As CancerModels.org begins their next phase of development in Singapore and the APAC region, STCC looks forward to embarking on a meaningful partnership with them.


#### **Engaging in insightful dialogues with healthcare delegates from Indonesia**

CRIS hosted key healthcare leaders from Indonesia, including Dr L.
