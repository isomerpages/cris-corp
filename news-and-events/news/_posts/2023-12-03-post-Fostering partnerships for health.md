#### **Elevating Singapore's clinical research landscape**

Our team at the [Singapore Clinical Research Institute](https://scri.edu.sg) (SCRI) hosted several roundtable discussions this year, as part of their mission to enhance the standards of clinical research capabilities in Singapore.

In August 2023, the roundtable on Decentralised Clinical Trials drew over 70 clinical research professionals and featured a lively panel discussion with panellists from the Health Sciences Authority, [Cardiovascular Disease National Collaborative Enterprise](https://www.cadence-cvd.sg) (CADENCE), and representatives from the Singapore Association of Pharmaceutical Industries (SAPI). 

The session also included updates on SCRI’s key initiatives to strengthen Singapore's clinical research ecosystem, including the master clinical trial agreement to reduce trial start-up time, and expansion of regional Clinical Research Networks.


#### **Advancing regional research and collaboration through Clinical Research Networks**

As part of SCRI's commitment to develop Clinical Research Networks (CRN) to enhance regional research partnerships, several significant initiatives were launched this year. 

SCRI supported the implementation of the ADVANcing Clinical Evidence in Infectious Diseases (ADVANCE-ID) Network, a regional research collaboration involving research networks and 30 hospitals across Asia.

*SCRI-PAROS Meeting in Philippines*

In April 2023, a partnership was formed with the Philippines Pan Asian Resuscitation Outcomes Study (PAROS) with Pre-hospital and Emergency Care (PEC) providers conducting research in the Asia Pacific region. In May, SCRI organised the [Paediatric Acute and Critical Care Medicine Asian Network](https://www.scri.edu.sg/crn/pediatric-acute-critical-care-medicine-asian-network/about-paccman/) (PACCMAN) meeting in Phuket. The PACCMAN meeting comprised sharing sessions on paediatric trials and on current and upcoming PACCMAN studies, furthering the CRN’s aims to support and stimulate research in pediatric intensive care in Asia.


#### **STCC's first cross-border partnership with the Australian Victorian Cancer Biobank to empower biobanking and cancer research**

In September 2023, the [Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium](https://stcc.sg) (STCC) signed its first cross-border partnership with the Australian Victorian Cancer Biobank to foster collaborations in translational oncology research.

#### **Advancing Insights: STCC and Amgen embark on a Research Collaboration Agreement to study the biology of small cell lung cancer**

Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2020 globally, with 2.2 million new cases, accounting for 11.4% of cancers worldwide. In Singapore, lung cancer is also one of the three most frequently diagnosed cancer among patients, and is the leading cause of cancer deaths among males. Of these, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents approximately 10 to 15% of all lung cancer patients globally.

In September 2023, STCC and its institutional partners announced a collaboration with Amgen on a retrospective non-interventional study to better understand the biology of SCLC, using investigational tools that could expand the knowledge underpinning distinct molecular subtypes of SCLC to enable a targeted treatment approach.

This multi-centre retrospective non-interventional study will be conducted at the National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore General Hospital, and the National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore.
