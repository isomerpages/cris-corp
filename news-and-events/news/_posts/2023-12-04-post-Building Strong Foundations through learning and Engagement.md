#### SCRI Distinguished Contributor Award 2022 recognises outstanding Clinical Research Coordinators 

In January, Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI) recognised nine outstanding Clinical Research Coordinators (CRC) for the Distinguished Contributor Award 2022, from across the public healthcare clusters. The award recognises the significant contributions and dedication of CRCs to advance clinical research. In conjunction with the awards, SCRI also organised the SCRI-SingHealth CRC Webinar, where distinguished speakers spoke on the importance of a good study design in ensuring the quality of clinical trials.

The recipient of the Distinction award was Michelle Ren, Senior CRC from KK Women's and Children's Hospital. She coordinated a national COVID-19 vaccine study to ensure the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for young children, and  overcame challenges together with her team to complete the recruitment of 150 subjects within 3 weeks.

#### PRECISE and Science Centre Singapore's collaboration in education and fostering curiosity in precision medicine and genomics

In collaboration with Science Centre Singapore, PRECISE organised a series of educational initiatives to spark interest and educate youths in precision medicine and genomics. On 15 April, a forum was organised to introduce precision medicine and its benefits on the course of health and medicine. As part of the collaboration, ISawtheScience (a blog by Science Centre Singapore) also interviewed Dr. Seow Shih Wee, Director, Corporate Services at PRECISE, to create an informational article about [precision medicine](https://blog.science.edu.sg/2023/06/22/ists-asks-precision-medicine/).

On 4 September, to mark the 70th anniversary of the discovery of the DNA double helix, the [Understanding Genomics](https://blog.science.edu.sg/2023/09/04/understanding-genomics/) forum was held to enlighten the younger generation about the pivotal role genomics plays in maintaining health and causing disease. The speakers included Dr Seow Shih Wee, A/Prof Ng Kar Hui, Senior Consultant, Paediatric Kidney Transplantation Programme, National University Hospital, and A/Prof Joanne Ngeow, Head, Cancer Genetics Service, National Cancer Centre Singapore and Associate Professor of Genomic Medicine at Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, NTU.

Some 60 secondary school, pre-tertiary and tertiary students attended the session and learnt about the positive outcomes of precision medicine, significance of the [SG10K](https://www.npm.sg/sg10k-discoveries-from-mapping-10000-genomes/) and [SG100K](https://www.npm.sg/sg100k-translating-insights-from-100000-genomic-data-sets-into-improved-health-strategies/) studies, A/Prof Ng’s [Clinical Implementation Pilot](https://www.npm.sg/cip/) for primary glomerular diseases, and the students also benefitted from A/Prof Ngeow’s sharing of her experience as an oncologist and the importance of genetics in cancer prevention.

The final installment of the series on 4 Nov invited esteemed speakers Dr Seow Shih Wee, Dr Li Jingmei from Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR)’s Genome Institute of Singapore and A/Prof Wee Hwee Lin from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore. They shared insights into the NPM programme, DNA sequencing and effects of medication and how our genes may influence the effects of our medication.

#### Precision Public Health Asia 2023 Conference

PRECISE organised a panel featuring speakers from public healthcare, start-ups and academia at the Precision Public Health Asia 2023 Conference in July. Panellists shared insights on data and stakeholder management, precision medicine and systems, and discussed two ongoing clinical pilots supported by PRECISE on Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) and Pharmacogenomics (PGx). Key learnings and takeaways included leveraging of digital platforms for FH awareness, developing training tools for healthcare professionals to provide genetic counselling to families, and fostering public-private collaborations for digital solutions.

#### Empowering tomorrow’s leaders: ACTRIS Cell Therapy lecture series fuels education and training for scientists and clinicians

As part of Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore’s commitment to train and educate the next generation of scientists and clinicians in cellular-based therapy support, a series of six educational videos were developed. These videos showcased speakers from public healthcare institutions and institutes of higher learning who shared their expertise generously, and their insights stirred active participation and keen interest from attendees during the question-and-answer segments.

This year, the series of videos covered topics such as exosomes & car-T therapy, virus-specific T-cells, natural killer cell therapeutics, non-viral reprogrammed mesenchymal stem cells in oncology, dendritic cells for immunotherapy and bone regeneration.  The series of videos can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/@actriseducationtraining5655).
