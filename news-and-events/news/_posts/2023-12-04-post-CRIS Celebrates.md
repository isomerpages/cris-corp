#### Unveiling the CRIS values – Respect, Integrity, Collaboration, and Excellence (RICE) in a spectacular launch event

This year, a significant milestone was the launch of our CRIS Values in July. We first embarked on a Culture Journey in October 2022, where staff shared their thoughts on our core values and forged a stronger CRIS identity. Leaders from across our programmes also gathered to crystalise the discussion and co-created our CRIS Values – Respect, Integrity, Collaboration and Excellence (RICE). These values will guide us towards our common goal of keeping Singapore at the forefront of clinical and translational research innovation, while actively advancing the sustainability and quality of Singapore’s healthcare system. 

Staff also participated in many activities throughout the year, which reinforced our CRIS Values. During our first-ever CRIS Family Day, more than 50 staff gathered with family and pets in tow for an afternoon of fun and games at Labrador Park, including a “CRIS Amazing Race” and a heartwarming BBQ dinner by the sea! In September, over 70 CRIS employees came together to unleash their culinary creativity at a team bonding cooking workshop at Palette Sensations. Staff teamed up to craft a three-course meal and enjoyed their fruits of labour after the session. What made this session even more special was the unique activity of crafting food sculptures that symbolised our CRIS core values.

##### CRIS at the NMRC Awards: Celebrating excellence in medical research and showcasing innovation

This year at the National Medical Research Council Awards Ceremony and Research Symposium, CRIS met participants from across the academic and clinical research community, including those from funding agencies, venture investment and healthcare research. At our booth, we shared more about the various ways in which CRIS and our programmes provide a leading edge for clinician researchers, innovators, medtech and healthtech talent in Singapore to advance and develop their capabilities in clinical research and translation.

Additionally, three of NHIC’s portfolio companies FathomX, PROMinsight, and EyRIS also had the opportunity to showcase their innovations to the clinical and research community.

Heartiest congratulations to awardees from CRIS and valued members of our Board Oversight Committees, including Prof Derek Hausenloy, Prof Patrick Tan, A/Prof Han Chong Toh, A/Prof Ker Kan Tan, Prof Tai E Shyong, A/Prof Iain Tan, Dr Jason Chan and Dr Shir Lynn Lim.

#### NHIC Appreciation and Networking Night: Celebrating leadership transition, milestones and innovation in healthtech

On 18 Jan 2023, National Health Innovation Centre Singapore (NHIC) formally welcomed A/Prof Henry Ho as Executive Director and expressed appreciation for Prof Tina Wong for her dedication and guidance since 2017. Prof Tina’s leadership saw the launch of several successful programmes such as I2START, boosting innovative clinical technologies for Singapore. 

With A/Prof Ho at the helm, NHIC has had an exciting and fulfilling year of meaningful achievements and milestones. As an accomplished and passionate innovator who has turned research ideas into commercial products, driving their adoption in hospitals, he has also actively supported fellow innovators in their projects.  

A highlight of the event was the lively “Lohei” and networking session, bringing together NHIC's Clinical Advancement and Development for Research Entrepreneurship and Enterprise (CADRE2) partners, healthcare innovators, government agencies, spin-off, and innovation offices. The gathering of industry professionals, united by their passion for Healthtech, offered a platform for exchange of ideas and potential collaborations. An inspiring occasion for everyone involved.
