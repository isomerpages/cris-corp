<p>As Father's Day approaches, we delve into the lives of seven remarkable
dads who not only excel in their respective fields in healthcare research,
but also navigate their parenthood journeys with drive and dedication.</p>
<p>Meet A/Prof Prof Danny Soon, Mr Vernon Tan, Prof Derek Hausenloy, Dr Roger
Chuah, Prof Tai E Shyong, Mr Eric Seow and Mr Yap Han, whose diverse experiences
in clinical research, innovation and healthcare, shed light on the intricate
balance between professional pursuits and the profound responsibilities
of fatherhood.</p>
<p>From leading roles in scientific organisations to dynamic positions in
healthcare research, innovation and translational programmes, each father
brings a unique perspective to the intersection of professional pursuits
and parenting. Through their stories, we glimpse the challenges and heartfelt
moments of fatherhood as they leave an indelible mark in both in their
professional endeavours and in the hearts of their families.</p>
<h4><strong>A/Prof Danny Soon: Leading National Research and Family Adventures</strong></h4>
<p>A/Prof Danny Soon is the Chief Executive Officer at <a href="https://www.cris.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS)</a><strong>,</strong> Executive
Director at <a href="https://www.cris.sg/our-programmes/scri/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI)</a> and
Interim Executive Director of <a href="https://www.actris.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore (ACTRIS)</a>.
With three sons, 16-year-old Tyler, 19-year-old Dillion and 21-year-old
Caleb, Danny takes lessons from home and his professional life and applies
them reciprocally. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As the inaugural CEO of CRIS, Danny helped to bring the six research programmes
and platforms under CRIS, fostering synergies and developing strategies
to enable them to achieve their missions. He also built the corporate functions
to support the entire entity. In the same vein, he sees the family environment
as fundamental in supporting his children towards achieving their goals.</p>
<p>Danny shares how family holidays always include a learning element, with
his children helping to plan and navigate their self-drive itineraries.
Whether skiing in Italy or hiking in Tasmania, the Soon family creates
lasting memories while fostering a love for exploration and discovery.
As he has three boys, sports has always been a bonding activity, especially
football!</p>

</p>
<p>Danny's perspective on fatherhood emphasises the importance of teamwork
with his wife, as they support each other in guiding their children through
life's challenges and triumphs while giving their children space to grow
and the freedom to pursue their interests.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his role as a father, Danny appreciates the expanded family
conversation topics as his children grow and their interests converge,
in areas like pop music, sports and world affairs. He emphasises the importance
of teaching his children to take a methodical approach in their work, encouraging
them to set and achieve goals. His children, in turn, inspire him with
their willingness to try new things and their positive attitudes.</p>

</p>
<p>For Danny, the best Father's Day present is quality time with his family,
cherishing the simple joys of togetherness above all else. A running joke
in their family is whenever his sons ask how much longer their hikes will
take, his always replies “ten more minutes”. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Vernon Tan: The IT Guru and Outdoor Adventure Dad</strong></h4>
<p>Vernon, Senior Manager and IT Programme Lead<strong> </strong>at <a href="https://www.actris.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore (ACTRIS)</a>,
is no stranger to IT project management. His role demands specific skillsets
and efficiency, yet amidst the bustling world of technology, Vernon finds
joy and fulfilment in spending quality time with his three children. His
two daughters, Tiffany, 15 and Trenise, 12, and his nine year-old son Treyden
enjoy skating with their dad amid lush greenery at East Coast Park and
Gardens by the Bay.</p>
<p>From managing essential laboratory support functions to managing new IT
projects, and setting up the essential infrastructure for ACTRIS, Vernon
shares that being a dad has honed his time management skills, fostering
personal growth and increased efficiency at work. Prioritising important
tasks at home and work ensures a balanced life, and he strives to separate
work-related demands from family time.</p>

<p>Whether bonding over catch-up meals with their favourite ramen or enjoying
movie nights, Vernon's commitment to fostering meaningful connections with
his children mirrors his dedication to being fully present at work and
at home. He fondly recalls their latest adventures, from night safaris
and river explorations to bird park escapades. Through nurturing his children,
he has also mastered the art of effective communication, which is also
applicable in his professional life.</p>
<p>For Vernon, the best Father's Day present is the presence of his children,
whose laughter and love bring immeasurable joy to his life. Seeing his
children after a long day drives away fatigue and fills him with happiness.</p>
<h4><strong>Prof Derek Hausenloy: Striking Steady Rhythm and Balance at Work and at Home</strong></h4>
<p>Prof Derek Hausenloy is the Executive Director of <a href="https://www.cadence-cvd.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Cardiovascular Disease National Collaborative Enterprise (CADENCE)</a> and
a Cardiologist, who embraces the journey of fatherhood alongside his commitment

son, Jason, Derek navigates the complexities of science and parenting with
unwavering dedication.</p>
<p>Together with his co-director, Mark Chan and Assistant Director, Sock
Hwee from CADENCE, Derek works with his team to establish national platforms&nbsp;focused
on data science, clinical trials, and artificial intelligence/digital health.
Through CADENCE, they unite clinicians and researchers across Singapore
to improve health outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Derek shares that finding the right balance between career and fatherhood
is challenging at times, but seeing his children grow and thrive makes
it worthwhile. Despite discouraging his children from following in his
footsteps in medicine and science, Derek and his wife are fully supportive
of their daughter’s burgeoning interests and aspirations in the field.
He cherishes the moments spent with his children as they navigate life's
transitions together – creating shared experiences and bonding through
life’s challenges.</p>

</p>
<p>Derek's fatherhood journey is marked by heartwarming memories and dedication
to caring for his children. He recalls fond memories such as their never-ending
quest for Chinese cuisine during European travels when his son, Jason,
was younger, as he refused to eat anything else.</p>
<p>Being a dad has given him a rewarding opportunity to be a positive role
model. He strives to embody and emphasise the value of hard work, dedication
and responsibility, and is heartened knowing that he has made a positive
difference in his children’s lives as they too strive to make a difference
in the lives of others.</p>
<p>Given the busy schedules of his teenagers – savouring the simple joys
of togetherness and sharing a meal at their favourite restaurant is what
he appreciates the most.</p>
<p>In anticipation of Father’s Day, his children share their heartfelt thoughts,
“What we love most is that dad has always had so much unwavering confidence
in us, being staunchly on our side, and always encouraging us to do our
best. We are so lucky to have you and Mummy. At every critical point of
our lives, where we’ve needed your comfort and practical guidance, we’ve
always had it.”</p>
<h4><strong>Dr Roger Chuah: Bridging Healthcare Innovation and Nurturing Wonder</strong></h4>
<p>Dr Roger Chuah is a dynamic force in the healthcare innovation landscape,
serving as an integral part of the team at <a href="https://www.nhic.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Health Innovation Centre Singapore (NHIC)</a>.
With a career spanning biomedical research and innovation and entrepreneurship,
Roger brings a wealth of experience to his role. Roger enables the commercialisation
and translation of healthcare innovations through strategic guidance and
fostering partnerships within the public healthcare ecosystem. His passion
for driving positive change in healthcare is evident in the milestones
achieved and the numerous innovations brought to fruition by clinicians.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a young son who is currently five and a half years old, Roger’s son
Min Yew is a lively and inquisitive child who fills his life with joy and
wonder. He enjoys every moment spent with his child, whether it's splashing
in a pool or exploring playgrounds together. Experiencing the wonder and
innocence of childhood through his child’s eyes rekindles his own sense
of curiosity and imagination. At his son's young age, he expresses himself
through creative drawings and enjoys playing with other young children.</p>
<p>Balancing the responsibilities of fatherhood with a career in healthcare
innovation has shaped Roger's perspective on success and fulfilment. He
recognises the importance of embracing life's challenges, instilling values
of integrity and responsibility. He teaches his child to embrace success
and failure as integral parts of one’s journey to becoming stronger and
wiser, and encourages empathy and teamwork, in the hope that he will build
meaningful relationships in time to come.</p>

</p>
<p>Roger's fatherhood journey is marked by heartwarming memories and laughter,
creating shared experiences like family vacations, weekend adventures,
or simple moments spent at home. At a young age, his son is already a protective
and clever young man, who offers to help his mother carry her groceries,
cheekily passing them to Roger after some time.</p>
<p>As Father's Day approaches, he looks forward to the simple joys of quality
time with his family, cherishing the gift of togetherness in their daily
lives. At his young age, his son knows that Roger helps clinicians bring
innovations to life to help people and has expressed interest in careers
that help others. Reflecting on his child's appreciation for his work,
Roger finds fulfilment in knowing he has made a positive difference in
the lives of others.</p>
<h4><strong>Professor Tai E Shyong: Precision Medicine and Fatherhood in Harmony</strong></h4>
<p>Professor Tai E Shyong, Chief Medical Officer at <a href="https://www.npm.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE</a>),
helps create a community that integrates precision medicine and genomics
into clinical care to improve healthcare for all Singaporeans. His career
is a testament to his commitment to alleviating the impact of genetic factors
on health outcomes, mirroring his dedication to his role as a father to
Zac, 19, and Elizabeth, 15. The inherited nature of the diseases he studies
also means treating families rather than individuals. He shares, “What
we want to see is children grow up with both their parents at their side,
minimising instances when parents have to mourn the loss of their children—which
seems quite fitting for Father’s Day.”</p>
<p>Despite the demands of his professional life, E Shyong finds joy in simple
moments spent with his children, fostering open communication and shared
experiences. His favourite part of the day is when his children tell him
about their day or share what is on their minds. Whether during their daily
commute, on holiday in London or attending concerts together, his priority
is nurturing connections and spending quality time together. E Shyong shares
a photo of him with his daughter at the Taylor Swift concert this year,
where he sports a custom-made T-shirt by his daughter to mark the event.</p>

</p>
<p>Reflecting on fatherhood, E Shyong emphasises the importance of building
relationships, both at home and in his career. His key role involves making
connections with others to work towards a common purpose to improve healthcare
for Singaporeans. Similarly, his “work” at home is about building and maintaining
connections with his children in the hope that they identify common values
that will guide them through their lives – values such as human connection
and social purpose. For him, the essence of fatherhood lies in fostering
mutual understanding and shared values.</p>
<h4><strong>Eric Seow: Guiding Clinical Research and Growing Minds</strong></h4>
<p>Eric Seow, a Senior Clinical Research Associate (CRA) and Trainer at

For Eric, the joy and laughter of his children are the greatest Father's
Day gifts, encapsulating the essence of parenthood.</p>
<p>Reflecting on their father, Eric's children appreciate his patience, unconditional
love, and care. This Father's Day, they express their gratitude for having
the "Best Dad Ever" who is always there for them. They share, “My Dad is
always there for us when we are down sick. No matter how tired he is, he
will always be there to attend to us, make sure we take our medication,
sponging us to bring the fevers down.” Through his children’s eyes, Eric's
dedication to his role as a father shines brightly, leaving a lasting impact
on their lives.</p>
<h4><strong>Yap Han: Driving Cancer Research and Twin Joys</strong></h4>
<p>Yap Han, Senior Business Intelligence and Development Manager at <a href="https://www.stcc.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium (STCC)</a>,
provides a window into the dynamic interplay between fatherhood and his
professional responsibilities in a translational cancer research platform.
In his role, Han is instrumental in fostering industry and institutional
collaborations in cancer research and advancing STCC's mission to create
a cohesive and collaborative national-level cancer research and translation
platform. His dedication to his work shapes the landscape of oncological
innovation, contributing to both healthcare and economic progress for Singapore.</p>
<p>Through the lens of Han’s experiences as a dad, we uncover the intricate
balance between adjusting to new parenthood and a thriving career. With
a set of one-year-old twins, Yu Cheng and Yu Hui, Han shares that as new
parents, both him and his wife have had to communicate and work together
to provide the best care for their twins, sacrificing their sleep at times
and learning to manage their schedules with flexibility. &nbsp;</p>
