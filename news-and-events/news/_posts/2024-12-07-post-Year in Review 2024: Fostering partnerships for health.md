<p>STCC signed a collaborative agreement with the Victorian Cancer Biobank
in May 2024&nbsp; to bolster the biobanking and cancer research capabilities
of Victoria and Singapore.</p>
<p>The partnership will establish a catalogue where authorised researchers
from Victoria and Singapore can co-list and co-access vital and anonymised
biospecimens for their cancer research projects. This partnership with
VCB expands access and diversity to this vital resource, ensuring that
research discoveries translate into real-world impact for our patients.</p>
