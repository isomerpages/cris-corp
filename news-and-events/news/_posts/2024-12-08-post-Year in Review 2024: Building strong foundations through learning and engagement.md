<p>PRECISE showcased Singapore's National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme
at the Europe Biobank Week 2024 in Vienna, held from 14–17 May. The presentation
highlighted how NPM is bridging gaps in Asian health research, with a focus
on translating findings from Singapore’s ancestrally diverse population
into clinical settings, such as through the pre-emptive pharmacogenomics
clinical implementation pilot.</p>
<p>This year’s event, themed "Strengthening Biobanks and Biorepositories:
Collaborative Approaches for a Sustainable Future," fostered dialogue on
precision medicine, biobanking, artificial intelligence, and ethics. Several
sessions focused on the integration of ethics and AI, emphasising patient
partnerships to enhance translational outcomes.</p>
<p>By participating in this global forum, PRECISE underlined Singapore's
leadership in genomics research and precision healthcare. Their efforts,
alongside international collaborations, are poised to improve patient outcomes
and contribute to economic growth through innovation and strategic partnerships.</p>

<h4><strong>SCRI recognises outstanding Clinical Research Coordinators</strong></h4>
<p>In January 2024, the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI) recognised
nine outstanding Clinical Research Coordinators (CRC) for the Distinguished
Contributor Award 2023, from across the public healthcare clusters.</p>
<p>The award recognises the significant and steady contributions of CRCs
who form the bedrock of Singapore’s clinical research ecosystem.</p>
<p>The recipient of the Distinction award was Geraldine Lim, Manager of the
Clinical Trials and Research Unit at Changi General Hospital (CGH). Together
with her team, she successfully supported over 100 research studies in
areas such as drug efficacy, medical devices, and observational research
to enhance patient care. She has been instrumental in a significant research
study on primary aldosteronism, a treatable form of hypertension, led by
Clinical Assistant Professor Troy Puar since 2016. Her contributions included
conceptualising the study framework and overcoming operational challenges,
which culminated in the launch of clinical tests at the Shimadzu-CGH Clinomics
Centre in February 2023.</p>

<p>In April 2024, ACTRIS CliniMACS Prodigy© workshop, jointly organised with
Miltenyi Biotec, brought together a diverse group of researchers, biotech
manufacturing experts, and graduate students specialising in cell therapy
research, stem cell biology, and GMP-compliant cell manufacturing. Participants
gained hands-on experience and deep insights into the Adherent Cell Culture
(ACC) process, learning how these systems enable the culture and expansion
of stem cells within a GMP-compliant setting.</p>
<p>The interactive session allowed participants to explore the system and
customise modular applications, fostering a collaborative and innovative
learning environment.</p>
<p>Through these training initiatives, ACTRIS aims to equip the local cell
therapy workforce with the skills and knowledge needed to leverage new
technologies for targeted therapeutic interventions. The goal is to build
a strong community of experts in cell and gene therapy, driving future
innovations to improve patient outcomes.</p>

<p>In March 2024, SCRI launched its new Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC)
Internship Programme, welcoming 22 interns from Nanyang Technological University,
Nanyang Polytechnic, and Ngee Ann Polytechnic.</p>
<p>Throughout the internship, the students will gain hands-on experience
at various hospitals, including National University Hospital and Singapore
General Hospital, where they will assist with clinical trials, interact
with patients, and learn from senior CRCs. This programme aims to equip
students with the skills and knowledge to build a career in clinical research
and contribute to the future of healthcare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On 24 September 2024, CArdiovascular DiseasE National Collaborative Enterprise
(CADENCE) participated at the event hosted on the sidelines of the 79<sup>th</sup> United
National General Assembly (UNGA) by Novartis Foundation and Foreign Policy.
They presented on Singapore’s participation in the AI4HealthyCities (AI4HC)
research study helmed by the Novartis Foundation. The Singapore study specifically
examined the influence of social determinants of health (SDoH) on cardiovascular
health and disease outcomes among the local population.</p>
<p>CADENCE is proud to be involved in this study and is eager to leverage
these research insights on cardiovascular health. The aim is to establish
a regional blueprint that enables Singapore and other countries to make
informed decisions on targeting health resources toward effective interventions
that can improve population health in the future.</p>

<p>On 31 May 2024, PRECISE supported Science Centre Singapore on a DNA workshop
for over 120 students, aimed at educating and inspiring the next generation
of precision medicine experts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students from Jurong-Pioneer Junior College had the exciting opportunity
to extract their own DNA to conduct a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
test if they had the bitter taste receptor gene and which imparts the ability
to taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). This immersive experience not only
sparked their curiosity but also provided a practical understanding of
the science behind genomics and a prelude to understanding precision medicine.</p>
<p>This workshop is part of PRECISE's ongoing commitment to build a robust
workforce for the future of precision medicine.</p>
