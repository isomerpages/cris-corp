<p>On 24 July 2024, STCC was inaugurated into the immunotherapy Centers Of
Research Excellence (imCORE) Network, along with Roche and Genentech. As
a member of this prestigious global network, STCC will collaborate with
leading cancer research institutions to accelerate research on immuno-oncology
and advance the development of cancer immunotherapy (CIT) treatment for
patients. Among the 27 institutions in the network, STCC is the first from
Southeast Asia, and the first consortium to join, leading a coalition of
Singapore's public healthcare and research institutions in the cancer research
and translation ecosystem,</p>
<p>As part of this international expert network, STCC will now be able to
participate in global cancer trials, providing Singapore with greater access
to cutting-edge research and novel cancer drugs. This partnership not only
enhances collaboration, but also holds the potential to pioneer novel immunotherapeutic
strategies that can address current unmet medical needs for patients in
Singapore.</p>

<p>On 30 July 2024, SCRI successfully launched <a href="https://clinicaltrials.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ClinicalTrials.SG</a> (CTSG) at the opening
of the SCRI Clinical Trials Symposium – The Promise of Clinical Trials:
Transforming Tomorrow’s Health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CTSG is a centralised portal designed for patients, caregivers, clinical
investigators and corporations. The portal aims to demystify clinical research
by providing clear and comprehensible information, while also promoting
research excellence in Singapore by catering to the diverse needs of the
research community.</p>
<p>The symposium, a first of its kind for the clinical research community
in Singapore, brought together 500 clinicians, researchers, academics,
and industry experts from both the public and private sectors, along with
patients and clinical trial participants, in a collaborative effort to
advance clinical research.</p>

</div>
<p>On 26 February 2024, PRECISE signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
with A*STAR’s DxD Hub - Diagnostics Development Hub, to catalyse translational
research and diagnostic development for precision health.</p>
<p>With this partnership, researchers and industry partners can now not only
utilise datasets from the NPM programme for research and discovery, but
also productise their discoveries by leveraging the expertise of DxD Hub.
Beyond translational research, the data output has the potential to be
converted into novel diagnostic assays and instrumental platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As these datasets continue to drive the translation of insights from bench
to bedside, PRECISE looks forward to facilitating more such partnerships
to make a positive impact on diverse communities worldwide, with a particular
focus on Asian populations.</p>

<p>STCC launched its National Health Economics on Cancer project in June
2024, a collaborative effort that brings together experts from leading
institutions such as the Ministry of Health, National Cancer Centre Singapore,
National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, Tan Tock Seng Hospital,
and NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. This initiative aims to
provide a comprehensive assessment of the cancer landscape in Singapore,
focusing on key areas like cancer incidence, stage distribution, and mortality
rates, stratified by demographics.</p>
<p>By leveraging data-driven insights, the project aims to identify critical
areas within cancer care and prevention that require improvement. The goal
is to inform decision-making and support the development of evidence-based
policies that will enhance cancer outcomes for patients across Singapore.
Beyond analysis, the project seeks to advance cancer care and public health
initiatives in the region, contributing to more effective and patient-centred
healthcare solutions.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, NHIC has been a key enabler in driving innovation
across various flagship events organised by our public healthcare clusters.
These include the SingHealth Duke-NUS Annual Scientific Meeting, CHI Innovate,
NUHS Scientific &amp; Innovation Summit, Singapore Healthcare Management
Congress (SHMC), and Singapore Healthcare Biomedical Congress (SHBC), showcasing
cutting-edge technologies from NHIC's innovation, commercialisation, and
adoption portfolio.</p>
<h4><strong>CADENCE and Medera launch Asia’s first multi-centre gene therapy clinical trial aimed at treating heart failure</strong></h4>

</div>
<p>On 19 November 2024, CADENCE and Medera announced the initiation of Asia’s
first multi-centre gene therapy clinical trial aimed at treating heart
failure, with Singapore being the first and only site selected outside
of the United States (US).</p>
<p>This trial marks the first collaboration between Singapore's two national
heart centres (National Heart Centre Singapore and National University
Heart Centre Singapore), and with Tan Tock Seng Hospital. This is a testament
to the country’s robust cardiovascular research infrastructure. It also
highlights CADENCE’s efforts in increasing clinical trial efficiencies
across these institutions by streamlining contracting procedures, simplifying
the costs of conducting cardiovascular clinical trials across these sites,
as well as providing a centralised point of-contact for companies looking
to conduct clinical trials and bring novel therapies to Singapore.</p>
