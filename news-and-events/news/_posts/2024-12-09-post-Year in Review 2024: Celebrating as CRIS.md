<p>CRIS held its first gathering of the year with a vibrant Lunar New Year
celebration, bringing together over 90 staff. Colleagues learnt more about
one another, such as who bakes Lunar New Year snacks, and who sports the
season’s latest hairstyles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event was filled with meaningful conversations, setting a positive
tone for the year ahead, as we continue to drive impactful projects for
the clinical research community.

<p>Our National Day celebration brought 130 CRIS employees together for an
exhilarating team-building adventure at Jewel Changi Airport, as part of
#CRISTHRIVE, an initiative focused on staff wellness and development. This
indoor expedition encouraged staff to draw upon our organisational values—Respect,
Integrity, Collaboration, and Excellence—while uncovering fun facts about
Jewel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This fun-filled day reinforced our commitment to working together as one
thriving CRIS family, making a positive impact for patients and researchers
in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
