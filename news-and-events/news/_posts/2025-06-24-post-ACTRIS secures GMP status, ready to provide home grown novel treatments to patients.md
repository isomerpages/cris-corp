<p><em>In this editorial, get a behind-the-scenes peek of the 20-month endeavour which rallied over 6 departments ACTRIS-wide to get its 14 Good Manufacturing Practice-compliant (GMP) clean suites ready, the largest national facility of its kind ready for use to serve hospital services, academic institutions for research, and biotech start-ups in Singapore.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Meet the incredible teams who orchestrated ACTRIS’ journey to operational readiness and how they navigated hoops and hurdles of SOPs, policies, and protocols to launch toward success.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>We speak with key leads from ACTRIS’ various departments where mutual trust in one another’s expertise was evident in this feat.</em>

<h3><strong><u>A facility to manufacture CAR-T therapies in the face of rising cancer incidence</u></strong></h3>
<p>In Singapore, it is expected that 1 in 4 Singaporeans will be diagnosed
with cancer by the age of 75. Cell, tissue and gene therapy (CGT) has come
to the fore as possible treatment options for certain forms of blood cancer.
Advances in CGT research have now opened up new ways to treat cancer with
cells, dubbed as “living drugs”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>One such class of products available locally is the chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) T-cell that uses patients’ immune cells to target specific cancer
cells. Patients who are undergoing CAR-T therapy would first have their
immune cells collected in hospitals; these live cells would then be transported
to a GMP-compliant facility where it undergoes various stages of processing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACTRIS, which was officially launched in August 2023, is the largest facility
alongside several smaller CGT manufacturing facilities available in Singapore
prior. For many of the lab officers and staff in ACTRIS, this would be
their first full-scale GMP inspection for a 1,450 sqm CGT facility, a significant
career milestone indeed.</p>
<h3><strong><u>The road to becoming fully operational</u></strong></h3>
<p>Following the launch, ACTRIS needed two critical green lights before it
could be considered fully operational: a Manufacturer’s License to support
manufacturing of products to be given to patients under specially authorised
clinical use and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification to supporting
manufacturing of investigational products in clinical trials.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Both required rigorous, months-long preparation which culminated in a
one-week inspection that pushed the limits of the young ACTRIS team, many
of whom joining mid-way on this journey.</p>
<p>This mammoth task pulled together the strength of all four GMP-related
departments across ACTRIS. “We assembled a taskforce led by Dr Francesca
Lim, who was the first and then Chief Medical Officer of ACTRIS, to lay
the groundwork, identify potential gaps, and work on closing them to mitigate
costly errors,” Mr Samuel Yang, Head of Quality said.</p>
<p>Comprising leads from Quality, Lab &amp; Production (L&amp;P), General
Operations (Gen Ops) and Translational Services and Regulatory Management
(TSRM), the taskforce met twice weekly for months to outline project plans.
Among them was Ms Wong Silk Yean, Head of Gen Ops, whose team had been
deeply involved since the facility’s construction back in 2022. Their familiarity
with the layout and operations proved invaluable as they quickly briefed
and brought new joiners up to speed.</p>
<p>“Under the Gen Ops department, our Facility &amp; Logistics team pre-emptively
identified potential gaps and ensured every piece of documentation was
ready for the assessors. It was a lot of groundwork, but it laid the foundation
for everything that came after,” Silk Yean said.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong><u>Building firm foundations through solid workflows and maintaining the clean suites</u></strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>In line with the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) guidelines for GMP manufacturing
of CGT products, the team had to provide a comprehensively designed and
well-implemented Quality System that not only complied with GMP standards
but also incorporated risk management protocols, that had to be well documented
in written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like a risk-assessment exercise, preparing for the inspection also
meant producing a fully mapped out Corrective and Preventive Action plan,
leaving no stone unturned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the team could draw on their previous experiences, the reality of
operating in a brand new facility brought with it a fresh slate, and most
workflows had to be created from scratch. “On average, this would usually
take a year to a year and a half. But we had to expedite the entire effort
to six months,” Silk Yean said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each SOP required an in-depth understanding of the GMP guidelines, performing
GAP assessments and rounds of rigorous reviews before the Quality department
could approve them. It was an arm-in-arm effort across the board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against all odds, the team developed an original set of workflows in that
time frame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together with the Quality department, by the end of 2024, <strong>ACTRIS had prepared a total of 221 SOPs and 487 GMP documents</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The L&amp;P department also had their hands full with maintaining the
clean suites and ensuring all equipment and air-handling systems were properly
qualified and ready for use – it was a tedious task, given the sheer volume
of equipment under their care. As with celebrating small wins, the team
first focused to get two clean suites operationally ready for product introduction
during the inspection, and thereafter, continually tweak their approach
till the official inspection in September 2024.</p>
<p>
<br>“It was an extremely stressful and jam-packed time, and we were heartened
by the welfare support from the administrative team who ordered in catered
meals, these gestures lifted our spirits and reminded us that we were not
alone,” Silk Yean said.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong><u>Staying a step ahead with no room for error</u></strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>As the months whittled down and the inspection dates loomed closer, the
taskforce ramped up its preparations, running several dry runs on a weekly
basis to fine-tune every documented process. Each session was an opportunity
to rectify, put in stop-gap measures and improve, tweak presentation flows,
and sharpen the team’s coordinated response strategy. Scribes were appointed
as ‘eyes and ears’ at every station to ensure every detail could contribute
to learning points and ensure seamless communication during simulations.</p>
<p>“The capabilities of the clean suites ensure that CAR-T cells, which are
live cells are transported to a GMP-compliant facility, where it undergoes
various stages of processing. Hence, to put it simply, there is no room
for error, both on the equipment front and staff protocol front,” Samuel
said.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong><u>Team insights: ‘Gemba’ may be the alternative ‘G’ in GMP</u></strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Ms June Chia, Head of L&amp;P, recounts the many dry runs with professional
experienced GMP practitioners from the ecosystem. These dry runs involved
“Gemba walks”. She cites a phrase that is often used in manufacturing: <em>go to the Gemba.</em> &nbsp;It
is a concept rooted in the Japanese philosophy of going to the ‘real place’
to truly understand what happens on the ground — a tool that uses thorough
walkthroughs to observe and re-learn processes to bridge gaps between theory
and application.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During the actual inspection of the facility, equipment and utilities,
the mock audits proved valuable inpreparing the team to be quick on their
feet and answer quick-fire questions posed by the internal inspectors.
“We developed what was called storyboards, which were answers for anticipated
hot topics or gaps,” June shared. For example, if concerns were raised
about any workflows, the team would “already be few steps ahead and already
have mindmaps” to walk them through the controls in place to ensure compliance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“For the Logistics team, the storyboards ensured we could clearly explain
our SOPs and day- to-day workflows consistently to the inspectors. We termed
it the Golden Package,” Silk Yean added.</p>
<p>The package was a living blueprint that the team assembled through trial
and error and countless run-tests to ensure that workflows were seamless
and complied with GMP requirements. With practice and rigorous testing,
the team gained confidence that these manuals would be a treasured resource.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong><u>Perfectly attuned with one other</u></strong></h3>
<p>“On inspection day, we functioned like an orchestra performing a well-rehearsed
symphony,” Samuel said. By then, every cue, every note had been practised,
refined, and timed to perfection.</p>
<p>The Logistics and Warehouse Gen Ops teams were the first to be audited.</p>
<p></p>

<p>From there, the baton passed smoothly to the lab officers, where together
with the cell specialists, they performed demonstrations for handling live
cell cultures without a hitch. The lab officers explained their workflow
with clarity, emphasising how measures were in place to prevent cross-contamination
of living cells.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong><u>Developing cell therapies at scale</u></strong></h3>
<p>Live cell handling and processing plays a critical role in developing
cell therapies but scaling it for GMP manufacturing to achieve clinical
dosage poses complex challenges, such as incorporation of automation and
ensuring cell viability in maintained consistently in the bioreactors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was satisfying to see all stakeholders and staff coming together, showing
confidence and knowledge beyond their areas of responsibility. &nbsp;“In-depth
questions which would usually be answered by the Quality department, were
fielded confidently by our lab officers,” Samuel added.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong><u>Months of preparation came together in perfect harmony</u></strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>After the week-long inspection, ACTRIS worked on addressing the concerns
raised by the inspection team and proposed measures for mitigation. On
27 February 2025, ACTRIS was officially granted the Manufacturer's License
from HSA, along with the issuing of the GMP certificate.</p>
<p>The ACTRIS cell therapy facility is now officially licensed to produce
life-saving and regenerative therapies for patients in Singapore. Being
able to manufacture high-quality cell therapies locally will mean that
treatments can reach patients in less time, and they get access to life-saving
therapies sooner.</p>

</p>
<p>However, the ACTRIS team is not taking a breather just yet.</p>
<p>“This is only the beginning. Moving forward, we will continue to engage
with the ecosystem to demonstrate ACTRIS’ capabilities in supporting our
healthcare system and patients,” Adj A/Prof Yap Eng Soo, current Chief
Medical Officer of ACTRIS since 1 March 2025, said.</p>
<p>With the facility now fully licensed, “ACTRIS is ready to serve the needs
of the ecosystem. We have begun triaging the steady stream of business
opportunities on the horizon,” said Dr Sudipto Bari, Head of TSRM.</p>
<h3><strong><u>Setting the score for the road ahead</u></strong></h3>
<p>Samuel shared the immense pride he felt was not just from successfully
passing the inspection but to see those “who were facing their first inspection
at ACTRIS, step up despite the heavy responsibility.”</p>
<p>“Initially, everyone was just working in silos. However, as the months
passed, you start to see everyone working together and cheering each other
on. The audit was a testament to what we can do as a team,” June said.</p>
<p>“Despite our different backgrounds and expertise, we were driven by the
same mission to attain the certification and license to serve our local
patient population,” Silk Yean added.</p>
<p>As the team turns its focus to what lies ahead, A/Prof Aloysius Ho, Executive
Director, ACTRIS since 1 March 2025, reflected on the people who made it
possible, “The team’s dedication to getting this centre operationally ready
was evident. With the right infrastructure, talent and systems, it reflects
a shared commitment to advancing healthcare and enabling access to therapies
for those who need it most. I’m excited for what we’ll continue to build
together.”</p>
