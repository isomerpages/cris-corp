The [National Health Innovation Centre, Singapore](https://www.nhic.sg/) (NHIC) has launched a Clinical Innovation and Adoption Initiative to nurture promising healthtech projects for adoption and scaling across healthcare clusters in Singapore.

Projects selected can expect to receive funding of up to S$1 million each. The initiative is supported by the Ministry of Health and covers three clinical adoption themes: Screening, Diagnostics and Monitoring, and Intervention. The [grant call](https://for.sg/i2adopt) for the first theme will open in November 2022.

The Clinical Innovation and Adoption Initiative is part of the expansion of NHIC’s programmes to offer a holistic suite of support to power the development and adoption of healthtech innovations in Singapore, and facilitate their eventual commercialisation and scaling in and beyond Singapore, so as to ensure the cost-effectiveness of these innovations through economies of scale.
